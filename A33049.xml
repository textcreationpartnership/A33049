            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>OECONOMY</hi> of this Hiſtory.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ature's grand Hiſtoriographer mentions a Tree hee had ſeen at <hi>Tivoly,</hi> on whoſe Trunk were ingraffed ſeverall Branches that bare diſtinct ſorts of fruit; Here Cherries, there Plums, on that ſide Apricocks, on this Peaches: But this vegetive wonder could be of no long continuance, by reaſon its Radicall moiſture was diſtributed to ſo many Species. What will bee the Fate of this tender <hi>Sien,</hi> depends on the ſmiles or frownes of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <hi>Reader,</hi> from the influence of which it muſt either grow or wither; however in ſome ſort it is not unlike that Tree, ſince to the ſtock of the ſame ſubject are inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſome coyn'd varieties, which are but adopted to the maine Body of the Hiſtory; They are Clouds, yet inoffenſive (which Eclypſe not abſolutely the Daye's luſtre, but onely veile the Glory of the luminous Planet that formes it) or rather Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, in decking, ſomewhat diſguiſe, and lay a freſh Vermillion upon the pale Cheek of Truth: Some, by nature or evill cuſtome, have contracted ſuch a diſpoſition, that if an Hiſtory (according to their apprehenſions) carry an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Face, they can afford it no other ſtyle than of a Fable, never conſidering that our Eyes converſe dayly with a thouſand things which poſe our Reaſon; and many effects are palpably apparent to us, of whoſe Cauſes we are intirely ignorant. Another Tide of fantaſticall humours carries ſome Braines into a Belief, that Truths are Fables, as the former eſteem Fables, Truths. It is not unlikely, in regard this Hiſtory hath ſome reſemblance to <hi>Ovid's</hi> Fable of <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Ianthe</hi> (whence indeed the names of the Principall perſons in this Narration are borrowed) ſome will bee apt to ſay, It is either a fabulous Hiſtory, or a Fable Hiſtorized: I am as little Maſter of their Tongues as of their judgements, let it ſuffice for an equitable <hi>Reader's</hi> ſatisfaction and mine own, that I have it from an Authour ſo authentick, that his report is as far beyond Queſtion as Contradiction. Tis true, my renown'd Biſhop acknowledges there are diverſe Paſſages of his own invention inſerted in the Principall relation of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> fortune: But whoſoever would take away thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd Feathers, which He ſo ingeniouſly hath mixt to imbelliſh this Piece, would find its Body as little, in compariſon, as a Nightingale's, which the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> ſaid was nought elſe but a Voyce. Certain Works there are, whoſe ſpecious titles promiſe advantages in the Front, that are not to bee found in the Peruſall; Others within a rough and inconſiderable out-ſide, conteine the precious Pearles of good Learning and profitable Documents: And notwithſtanding at firſt they appear confuſed, or more beholding to Chance than any Method for their Contexture, yet (when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentively conſidered) do diſcloſe an agreeable Connexion, a well regulated Order, and no ill-obſerved Proportion. For which conſideration (Courteous Reader) I thought it not improper to preſent you this <hi>OECONOMY,</hi> to the end you may know, that among all the <hi>Romantick</hi> Hiſtories, which have fallen from my Author's Pen (and happily may have paſſ'd before your Eyes) there is not any that ſeem's
<pb facs="tcp:51476:3"/> leſs Methodicall, and yet is more anſwerable to the Rules than this. Be not therefore too ready to precſpitate your cenſure upon what your judicious Eye may incounter of leane and frivolous in this Story, Impartiality beeing able to require your Patience with the view of ſuch Heroick Actions in this volume as may countervaile the ſimplicity of the reſt; Though neither (in my opinion) be impertinent, unleſs you will deny the difference of Notes in Muſick to be requiſite for the compoſition of the moſt melodious Accords, and make Shadowes uſeleſs for the compoſition of the moſt melodious Accords, and make Shadowes uſeleſs for the imbelliſhment of Pictures, or diverſity of Flowers for enamelling delightfull Garden-Plotts. This Narration runs in a continuall line, and the ſubject threds it ſelf ſo inſenſibly, that you will feele your Fancy led (as it were) by a little chaine from one manner of Life to another, very different, without perceiving the change. <hi>Chymiſts</hi> give the name of Depart to a certain water which they uſe to ſeparate diverſe Metalls in one Lumpe; for your facility I ſhall make tryall of ſome ſuch, to Anatomize the body of this Work.</p>
            <p>As the Eternall Gaider of all things hath divided the Spacious Roof of Heaven into five diſtinct Zones; Or as the Dramatiſts diſpoſe their Stories into five Acts, ſubdividing them into ſeverall Scenes, So the Relation conteined in this volume is digeſted into five Principall Parts. The <hi>Firſt</hi> may properly be tearmed the <hi>IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FANTINE</hi> or <hi>INNOCENT;</hi> wherein you ſhall ſee the <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>IPHIGENES,</hi> with his pretty harmeleſs Employments during his tendreſt years. The <hi>Second</hi> you may call the <hi>AULICK</hi> or <hi>COURTLIE</hi> Part; In this <hi>IPHIGENES</hi> appears in his Glory at the <hi>Court,</hi> the Splendour, Policy, Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mines and Counterminings, with the reſt of the Beauties and Blemiſhes of that Life my Authour repreſents not impertinently. The <hi>Third</hi> is the <hi>RUSTICK;</hi> where our Grand Favorite is repreſented in ſome kinde of diſgrace (beeing confined to his <hi>Palatinate</hi>) amuſing himſelf in the exerciſes of Hunting and Rurall divertiſements: In this Part are deſcribed the diſcommodities and contentments of a Country-life, the imperfections of the vulgar People, Their rude, cruell and incivill diſpoſitions. The <hi>Fourth</hi> deſerves the title of <hi>HEROICK;</hi> becauſe it treats of Wars, Combats, Sieges, Stratagems, not without the intermixture of ſome Love-Plots, Negotiations of State-Affairs and Treaties of Peace, wherein our <hi>HEROS</hi> diſplayes grand te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his Courage, and Conduct. The <hi>Fift</hi> and laſt is the <hi>NUPTIALL;</hi> Which, at the Marriage of <hi>IPHIGENES</hi> with <hi>LIANTE,</hi> repreſents the Banquets, Tiltings and Magnificences uſuall at ſuch ſolemnities, when <hi>KINGS</hi> will ſhew to thoſe they love the Marks of their Grandeur and Affection; Which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are herein but ſparingly deſcribed, becauſe the precedent Parts had already extended this Relation beyond the intended Limits; In any whereof if you finde either a Deficiency or Over-acting Conſider this Piece was compoſed by a Prelate, who (unleſs for his Divertiſement) was not accuſtomed to looſen his <hi>Genius</hi> to ſuch light ſtudies, yet hath been ſo fortunate as not to be leſs eſteemed for theſe Levities, by ſuch as are capable to judge of his Language, than admired for the Graver pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of his Pen; But if in my Dialect I have too weakly rendered his quaint Conceptions, I hope you will have Candour ſufficient to pardon my Defects, and incourage by your indulgence the indeavours of Him, whoſe Ambition was rather to delight you than content.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Polonia</hi> do commonly give their <hi>Monark</hi> the ſtyle of the KING OF KINGS, and LORD OF LORDS: Not that they are ſo prophane, as (by too exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a Blaſphemie) to raviſh that eminent quality from him that beareth it ingraven on the blade of his Almighty Juſtice, who diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth at his will of the Souls of Princes, and who is terrible above all the Kings of the Earth; But by reaſon of the form of Government in that Country, which is ballanced with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <hi>Ariſtocraticall</hi> temperature, that it ſeemes their King is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51476:9"/> only by the benefit of <hi>Inventarie</hi> (as it is tearmed:) For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Kings are extreamly abſolute, and have an uncontrouleable Power over the bodies, lives, and eſtates of their Subjects, diſpoſing of them at their wills and pleaſure (which is but according to the inſtitution of <hi>Royalty</hi> determined by Gods own Sacred Mouth, and couched in expreſs tearms in the holy Scripture.) It is nothing ſo amongſt the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> (ſo were the People of <hi>Polonia</hi> called) where the Sea of <hi>Monarchie</hi> hath its bounds, and what ſtorm ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever riſes in their King's heart, what impetuous Surges or motions of Paſſion ſoever agitate his breaſt, hee cannot in any proceedings exceed thoſe limits that are preſcribed to his Authority by the Power of his States. The opinion of that antient <hi>Emperor,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That properly to be a Sovereign, was to do whatſoever hee lifted,</hi> is of no eſteem or value with that Nation; Neither is leſs exploded there this ſaying of an imprudent Empreſs, <hi>That nothing was unlawfull for Kings to act, if it but pleaſed their humor.</hi> For in that Kingdome, whatſoever concerns the Power, Family and Function of the <hi>Monark,</hi> it is all ſo regulated, that Hee cannot deviate or out-ſtrip his bounds in the I eaſt, without drawing upon himſelf ſuddain Rebellions, and moſt formidable Combinations. The reaſon thereof proceeds from this reſpect, that among thoſe People (who are as free as fierce, and no leſs generous then haughty) the Kings are Elective, Succeſſion having no intereſt in that Crown, unleſs a Son, by his vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments and valorous Actions, render himſelf worthie (with the approbation of the Orders) to aſcend into the Throne of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors. From this libertie which the <hi>Polonians</hi> have of electing their <hi>Monark</hi> ariſeth this Reſtriction of the <hi>Royall</hi> Authoritie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch confined tearms and limitations, that it is no more poſſible than lawfull to exceed them, without altering the Harmony of that Direction which hath there been eſtabliſh'd beyond the reach of humane Memory, and exciting in the State Revolutions, or rather Convulrions of moſt dangerous conſequence. It is to be obſerved, that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks and the Nobility only have votes at theſe Elections: the third Order (which is, the Common People) is excluded, and muſt receive for their King, him, that is lawfully choſen, according to the form and cuſtome of the Country, by the other two Orders; Who after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (though they leave to the King the honour and prebeminence in all things, rendring him the homage and reverence that's due to a Sovereign, and all thoſe whom the hand of <hi>Providence</hi> hath raiſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51476:9"/> that high Dignity) reſerve to themſelves however the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and adminiſtring Juſtice, by which Kings reign, and by which they maintein the Regencie of their Kings and Lawes. As for the Eccleſiaſticall State, That hath its Policie apart, which particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth Spirituall Affairs, and the Conduct or Cure of Souls: And the Secular (which concerneth Politicall matters, as the exerciſe of Juſtice, aſwell Civill as Criminall, and the adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Military functions) is chiefly in the hands of certain great Officers, named <hi>Caſtellains &amp; Palatines,</hi> who are little Sovereign Lords, or Petty Kings, every one in his own Territorie. For inſtance, The <hi>Caſtellains</hi> are thoſe who have <hi>Lands, Citties, Burroughs, Villages</hi> and <hi>Seignories</hi> under their ſubjection, as for matters concerning Juſtice; and their Authority is ſo great, that their <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> is without Appeal. Moreover, in caſe of troubles, they have power to levie Forces, impoſe Taxes, raiſe Monie to pay and beare the charges of their <hi>Miltitia,</hi> and do other Actions in this nature, which in other <hi>Monarchies</hi> are reſerved only to the <hi>Sovereigntie.</hi> The <hi>Palatines</hi> are like Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, but they are ſo abſolute in their Governments, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Caſtellaines</hi> and the People at their pleaſure, exact Tributes, preſs Souldiers, appoint quarters, give Commiſſions: in a word, they are like petrie Kings in their <hi>Palatinates,</hi> ſuch ſuddain and exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is rendred them, ſo Supream and uncontroulable is their Power. Inſomuch that the King (to return to the Proverb before mentioned) commanding as King over the <hi>Palatines</hi> and <hi>Caſtellains,</hi> is in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration called KING OF KINGS, that is, of the <hi>Palatines,</hi> who are in effect petty Kings; and LORD OF LORES, that is, of the <hi>Caſtellains,</hi> who are like little Princes. The Hiſtory which I am about to relate, obligeth me to repreſent this form of Government, as being the <hi>Baſis</hi> and principall foundation thereof, by reaſon of the Power (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Tyrannicall) of one of theſe <hi>Palatines,</hi> who ſhall appear upon this Scene we are now opening, and who would ſeeme ſtrange, nay alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether extraordinary to the Reader, that ſhould fancy to himſelf a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ordered according to the Rule and Policie of FRANCE or SPAIN, where the <hi>Monark</hi> being more abſolute, the Authority of Governours is much leſſe; not unlike to that of the meaner Lights of th' Heaven, which have no light or luſter before the Sun of <hi>Sovereigntie:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary in <hi>Polonia</hi> the <hi>Palatines</hi> do execute their Charges, and exerciſe their Jurisdiction in the preſence of their King, as if their Authority depended rather on <hi>Monarchie</hi> then on the <hi>Monark,</hi> nothing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51476:10"/> being able to make them be depoſed or diſpoſſeſſed of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but State Crimes which make them loſe their Dignities with their Lives.</p>
               <p>Under the Reign of him that preceded <hi>MONSIEVR</hi> of <hi>France</hi> (then Brother to <hi>CHARLES</hi> the IX. and Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and who was afterwards <hi>HENRY</hi> the III. of <hi>France,</hi> having forſaken the Crown of <hi>Polonia</hi>) A certain <hi>Lord Caſtellain,</hi> by name <hi>Roſuald,</hi> who (though not deſcended of very antient Nobility, nor much in favour with Fortune for matter of eſtate) was elevated for his valour to the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Podolia.</hi> Governments and great Offices are like Veſſells full of liquor, whereinto if you caſt a ſpunge, though ne're ſo dry and hard, it will preſently be filled and pierced through. <hi>Roſuald</hi> was ſo able and underſtanding a Man, that without oppreſſing much his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or exacting any thing in his Province, that might render him any way odious or blameable, by ſubtile and (probably) lawfull means he became ſo rich, that (Peace by vertue of his mediation and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct reigning among all the families where hee introduced <hi>Concord</hi>) Abundance entred within his Territories; inſomuch that it might be ſaid of him, That Glorie and Riches were in his Houſe, That his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſunk under the burthen of Corn, his Cellers were overflowed with Wine, That out of the very ſtones burſt Rivulets of Oile, That his Coffers were not capacious enough to contein his Treaſures. In ſum, That hee was one of the moſt opulent <hi>Palatines</hi> in <hi>Polonia:</hi> But the inexorable <hi>Parca</hi> that pardons no body (and who being blinde cut's the thred of life when ſhe pleaſes, without diſtinction of Age, Condition or Sex) ſtopped the courſe of this <hi>Noble-man's</hi> dayes in the full Current of his Proſperitie (at ſuch years as but juſt paſſing out of <hi>Virility</hi> hee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted only the firſt and freſheſt time of Old-Age,) by an unexpected accident, which made him bring Death with him home from Hunting. His Lady, who was then big with Child (though otherwiſe verie chaſt and vertuous, yet a woman (that is to ſay) as litle capable of conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as a Reed of ſteadineſs) ſuffering her ſelf to be tranſported by the exceſs of an inconſolable ſorrow, precipitated her deliverie in the ſeaventh Month, and after a Son which ſhe had brought forth into the World, but one yeare before, She was made a Mother at this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and laſt labour of a Daughter, which had life, but by her death. For whether her grief and conceding anguiſh haſtned the birth of the Child, or whether becauſe her Body was no leſs cruelly afflicted with the Pangs of her Travell, then her mind for the loſs of her Husband,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51476:10"/> the Daughter remaining with the living, layed her Mother among the Dead, leaving theſe poor innocent Orphanes to the mercileſs pitty of Men; but under the tuition of that great King of Heaven and Earth, who taketh little Ones for his Heritage, who taketh care even of young Ravens when abandoned by their Dams, and who gives himſelf the ſtyle of Guardian and protector of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>In the charge of the <hi>Palatinate of Podolia</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Roſnald</hi> a <hi>Noble-Man</hi> of a middle Age, named <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who was born of a very antient &amp; noble Family: But that falls out in Generations ſometimes, which is alwaies incident to the moſt ſtately ſtructures, that is, Time with his gentle file doth inſenſibly waſte and diminiſh them; For it is frequently ſeen that the Nobleneſs of an Extraction advancing and inlarging its greatneſs by the long ſucceſſion of years, the Eſtate is divided into divers branches, which ſo weakneth and leſſeneth the ſtock, that in the end it is a ſhame to be ſo Noble and ſo poor, to have ſo great a Heart and ſuch weak Reins, that (not having faculties ſufficient) a man cannot maintein the ſplendor extracted from his Anceſters. For this Reaſon in great Houſes the heirs have in a manner all, to the end that by this induſtrie their wealth may ſerve as nerves and ſupporters to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that magnificence, which diſtinguiſheth thoſe of Illuſtrious Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents from the Vulgar. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> being elevated to this eminent Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (which renders men in <hi>Polonia</hi> of equall qualitie with the <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France, Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that is to ſay, the chief and moſt remarkable Perſons of that Country, for they are as much as <hi>Vice-Kings;</hi>) And ſeeing himſelf as mean for matter of Eſtate, as conſiderable for Honour both by Birth and Qualitie, was on a ſuddain caſt into an inconceivable diſtraction of Mind and pain; not much unlike unto that of the fabulous <hi>Midas,</hi> who not being able to feed or nouriſh himſelf, becauſ everie thing hee touched was preſently turn'd to Gold, poor in his abundance, Hee abhorred in a manner what he had aſpired to with ſo much eagerneſs, being angrie with himſelf that his Abilities would not reach to maintein by a competent and ſuiteable expence the Pomp and magnificence of his Dignitie. The Condition of this ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Sarmatian,</hi> me thinks, is very lively repreſented by the Child in the Emblem, whoſe wing ſeems to flutter up on one ſide, but the other is depreſſed to the ground with a heavie ſtone: being pricked one while with the ſpur of <hi>Glory</hi> (which puff'd him up by reaſon of his high birth and qualitie) another while being inflamed with an extreme deſire of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51476:11"/> having where withall to ſupport the Height of his Dignitie and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, He was like an high mettled Horſ, which feeling two ſharp ſpurrs in his Flank, curvets and fling's as if hee diſdained a Rider; But as the twiſting <hi>Ivie</hi> cannot raiſe it ſelf from the ground, unleſs it embrace the Trunk of ſome neighbouring Tree, or be back't by ſome kind Wall, ſo <hi>Mieſlas</hi> deeming Wealth the greateſt luſter, and (as it were) the main Pillar of Honour, reſolved to uſe any means (lawfull or unlawfull) to purchaſe it. The firſt that the Power (ſhall I ſay) or the Tyrannie of his new charge put into his greedy minde, was to load his ſhoulders with the ſweet burthen of the Gardianſhip of the two Pupills alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned, although their Kindred ſtrove to ſubvert his deſign, perceiving plainly that hee would prove like an <hi>Eagle</hi>'s feather, which eats away and conſumes the others, that is to ſay, That this old <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> would devoure thoſe pirtifull young Children: In a word, having by favour, obteined the Wardſhip, or tuition of them, and being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Authority in the government, or more properly, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their moſt plentifull eſtates (as hee ſucceeded their Father <hi>Roſuald</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate</hi>) without ſcruple hee made uſe of his riches to maintein the Port and Magnificence of his great Birth and Office. But that Eternall Power which reſides in Heaven, which preſides over the deſignes of Men, who ſees their thoughts a far off, knowes their waies and counts their ſteps, and who hath in his hands the ends of the Earth; It is he that diſſipates the Counſells of the wicked, and reproves their inventions. It is Hee that takes into his ſafe-guard the widow and the Fatherleſs, and confounds the waies of the evill-doers: As we ſhall ſee in the progreſs of this Narration, which will demonſtrate how <hi>Providence</hi> did by her diſpoſing, take the Counter-point in oppoſition to the purpoſes of <hi>Mieſlas;</hi> and whereas hee intended to ſwallow <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuald</hi>'s Eſtate, and make that Family fall into his, Heaven brought to paſs the contrary. For as the Appetite comes with eating, and the deſire of having being commonly compared to an Hydropicall humour, which the more it drinks the more it thirſts; <hi>Mieſlas</hi> not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the adminiſtration of his Ward's whole Eſtate, which hee found a very plentifull, and almoſt undreinable Source of Riches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee diſpoſed at his pleaſure (like one that cuts in the whole Piece) and made uſe of it to maintein the Pomp and State, that high degree of honour (whereunto Fortune had raiſed him) did require, aſwell to avoid any Demands or Inquiries, and not to be ſubject to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to any, as to make this Eſtate in ſome manner his own, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51476:11"/> without inchantment to make the Corn leap from another's ground upon his; Hee paſſionately deſired to draw unto himſelf that mighty Maſs of Wealth by ſome Alliance (the ordinary hook that great ones uſe to catch the fatteſt Preys.) But God who meerly by the confuſion of Tongues ſubverted the proud deſigne of the Children of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> laughing at the vain pretenſions of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> gave him no Off-ſpring but Daughters; and every body knowes that ſex is far more likely to tranſport a ſucceſſion into another family, then to continue a name and convey it to Poſterity. This multiplicity of Daughters put the fierce <hi>Sarmatian</hi> not only into impatience, but tranſported him into a boundleſſe and unheard-of fury: For as if his Wife (a Lady full of Honour and Vertue) had been voluntarily the cauſe of his diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he uſed her ſo barbarouſly, that his inhumanity drew upon him the hatred and ſcorn of the whole World. <hi>Iſaac</hi> at the importunity of <hi>Rebecca</hi> (who bad him get her Children, if hee would not ſee her dye with grief) anſwered, that hee was not God to give her <hi>Progenie:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that as it is not from him that plants, or from him that ſowes, that fruits proceed, but from God, who gives life and growth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and who opening his hand fills every creature with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and fecundity, ſo Husbands cannot give Iſſue, if God ſhowres not down upon their Marriage the Benediction of his ſweetneſs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they have Children according to their own wiſhes, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of him who is Creator of both Fathers and Children, and from whom proceeds all Paternity in Heaven and on Earth. It was by an induſtry inſpired from above, that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with white and black the Lambs of his flock, to inrich himſelf in <hi>Laban</hi>'s ſervice: But though he gave them ſuch coloured Coats as hee pleaſed by vertue of his wands, it was not in his power to make them of what Sex hee liſted. The diſcreet <hi>Aretuza</hi> (ſo ſhall <hi>Mieſlas</hi> his Wife be called) might have returned the ſame anſwer to her barbarous and unreaſonable Husband, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did to the extravagant demand of his Wife; But that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> was not to bee anſwered but by ſuffering and ſilence, otherwiſe hee would hvae raged like one of thoſe Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, which overturn every thing that oppoſes their turbulencie. And that which agravated the diſtemper of his mind, was not onely that he had none but Daughters, but what was worſe, and leſs ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in that Sex (whoſe Element is Beauty, or at leaſt a gracefull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which proceed's from a juſt and handſome compoſition) they brought into the World with them ſuch remarkable imperfections,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51476:12"/> and ſuch monſtrous deformities, that they could not appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique without making the Parents bluſh that had begotten them. The eldeſt was crump-ſhoulder'd and wrie-neck'd; the ſecond was hip-ſhot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and halted with both leggs; the third as ſomewhat handſomer in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was more ugly in face than either; the fourth (which was born at his firſt comming to that <hi>Palatinate</hi>) was not onely hulch-back't and ſquint-ey'd, but had one legg a great deal ſhorter then the other, which made her gate no leſs unſeemly then painfull. Theſe ſpectacles were ſo odious to the haught-ſpirited <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> that had hee lived in that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell <hi>Philoſopher's</hi> dayes, and followed his maxims, hee would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived thoſe wretched creatures of the life which hee had given them, for in his heart hee had no kinde of fatherly tenderneſs towards them, but conſidered and abhorred them as Monſters that ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the moſt ſecret defects within himſelf, and caſt confuſion in his Face, theatning him by their ill favoured aſpect with ſome malediction. To repeat the reviling tearms wherewith hee abuſed the innocence of his Wife, and the inſolent threats wherewith hee terrified her timidity, if ever ſhe ſhould bear him any more ſuch Children, is far from my deſigne, neither will my time permit it: Somtimes hee ſwore hee would repudiate her; Somtimes that hee would kill her as a Source and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Monſters; Sometimes hee upbraided her with faults whereof hee knew in his own conſcience ſhe was not guilty; Somtimes he tormented her with diſdainfull ſlightings; Sometimes hee would baniſh her his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and confine her to the Country; Sometimes keep her cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. To be ſhort, there was no kind of diſcontent but hee made her feele her ſhare of it; either Paſſion had ſo blinded his Reaſon, that hee could not ſee his own abſurdity, or elſ out of pure Malice hee had a deſigne to make her, through diſpair, caſt her ſelf into the Sepulcher. Notwithſtanding all this ill uſage, ſhee grew with Child again, which <hi>Mieſlas</hi> perceiving, hee proteſted if ſhe brought him forth (not onely an ill-favoured Daughter, but any Daughter) that hee would ſacrifice to his indignation both her and her fruit; and this hee ſealed with ſuch execrable oaths, and in ſo paſſionate a manner, that there was no doubt to be made but his Tongue ſpake out of the abundance of his heart, and the ſetledneſs of his reſolution. You may imagine in what a trance fell poor <hi>Aretuza,</hi> ſeeing her ſelf condemned to Death for a thing uncertain, and which ſhe was no way able to remedie. Piety made her reſign her ſelf totally to God's will, &amp; ſubmit to the inviolable decree of his <hi>Providence,</hi> knowing that thoſe who put their truſt in him never
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51476:12"/> are confounded; Nevertheleſs fearing to tempt him, ſhe omitted not the means of humane <hi>Prudence,</hi> God making uſe oft-times of theſe ſecond Cauſes to arrive unto that, whereto he diſpoſeth both thoughts and actions by an incomparable ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>Among the gentlewomen that attended her, ſhe had one (after the manner of great perſons) that was her particular Favorite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident: and although her ſweet diſpoſition begat her the affection of them all, and that they compaſſionated exceedingly her miſerie, yet knowing too well the imbecillity of her Sex for matter of keeping Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, ſhe thought it the ſafeſt way not to raveale her's to any more than one, leſt it being diſcloſed ſhee ſhould loſe the benefit and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhee promiſed her ſelf. You may underſtand already, that it was to change her Child, in caſe ſhee were brought to bed of a girle. <hi>Cleorite</hi> (her Truſtee) took the buſineſs upon her; and having found out ſeverall Women that were to lie down about the time of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe's account, ſhe blinded them with that powerfull powder of Gold which dazles all the World, and makes people undertake any thing. What then? The Heavens favoriſing the deſign of this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lady, gave birth to an earneſt occaſion, which drew <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to Court, even as the time drew neer of her deliverie; Inſomuch that being laid of a Daughter (as beautifull as an Angell, and whoſe grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſweetneſs might have moved to pitty the bowels of her Tyrannicall Father) a Boy newly born was put in her place, ſo cunningly, that thoſe (to whom <hi>Mieſlas</hi> has given charge to watch his wive's actions, and give him a faithfull teſtimony of that particular) were ſurpriſed, and happily deceived. To relate <hi>Mieſlas</hi> his joy when this news was brought him, were no eaſie matter. If by an expreſs command the <hi>King</hi> had not ſtaid him at Court, he would preſently have gone to ſee his Son, who adding to the quality of Male (which he had ſo ardently deſired) a beautifull face with a well-ſhaped body, rendred him no leſs ſatisfied than his former Daughters had given him diſcontent. To the fortunate birth of this Daughter (principall Subject of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veillous Hiſtorie, and who by her name gives it the Title of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> for reaſons which ſhall be produced in their time) ſucceeded the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrangeneſs of her education, which was thus.</p>
               <p>The King reliſhing the humour and the counſells of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and conſidering that his wit and high courage were worthy of employment, reteined him for the moſt part about his own perſon, giving him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſome commands in his Arimes; and he acquitted himſelfe of all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51476:13"/> his Commiſſions with ſo much prudence, fidelity and valour, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great reputation he had acquired, he had purchaſed a vaſt eſtate, but that his humour being exceſſively given to vanity (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an expence beyond all reaſon) what one hand ſaved the other ſpent, the King's liberalitie not being ſufficient to ſupport his Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, inſomuch (as the Proverb ſaith) it was but caſting monie into a bottomleſs bag. Sometimes he fiſhed wealth at Court, ſometimes in his Government, and every where he was obſerved to diſſipate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than diſpoſe of what he had. If he made any ſtay in his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he would ſo overcharge and exact upon his Subjects, that the chief <hi>Caſtellains</hi> wrought with the King under hand in ſuch ſort, that upon ſome pretence or other he was ſtill ſent for back againe to Court, to avoyd the ruine of the <hi>Province,</hi> and the trouble of further complaints. During theſe many journies and long abſences of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> grew up the hopefull <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> whom the carefull <hi>Aretuza</hi> had cauſed to be nurſed in a County remote from <hi>Podolia,</hi> having given charge of her to an antient and faithfull ſervant of her Father's, whom She made Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or Gardian of her Child and ſecret. Whileſt the ſuppoſed <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> paſſed his Infancy with <hi>Aretuza, Boleſlaüs</hi> (foſter-father of the true one) did not only make all thoſe that came to ſee her believe ſhe was a Boy, but bred the Child likewiſe in the ſame opinion; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her extraordinary tender Complexion ſeemed to accuſe her of being a Girle, yet the advantage of imagining her ſelfe to be of the robuſter Sex (added to the generoſity which ſhe had by Nature) made her not only incline, but delight in the ſports and exerciſes of Boyes, as if ſhe had been as her habit ſpake her.</p>
               <p>About two years after the birth of <hi>Iphigenes, Aretuza</hi> (who ſeemed to be ordeined to bring forth none but females, and fill the World with that Commodity which is hard enough to keep, yet harder to put off) was brought to bed of another Daughter, who had not ſo rare a Beauty as to make her be much admired, nor ſuch remarkable defects as might make her be deſpiſed. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> being then at Court, and having appealed his choller by the imagination he had of being Father to a goodly Son, expreſſed not much diſtaſte at the comming of this fift Daughter, eſpecially when he heard that ſhe was faire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and without deformity. <hi>Aretuza</hi> made her be named <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencia,</hi> as having experimented in her the Clemencie of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, of whoſe more courteous uſage ſhe began thence-forwards to have ſome hopes. Among great perſons Marriages doe not alwaies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51476:13"/> accompanie Baptiſme, but oftentimes precede it; for to allie illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous families, to purchaſe a ſupport, to maintaine factions, and effect divers other ſuch practiſes frequently uſed in Courts, Parents doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times promiſe to marry their Children before they are in Being, as many do procure benefices and charges for the Children which they ſhall have: whence an eminent man of our times tooke occaſion to ſay, That it was no marvell if great Ladies had hard labours, ſince their Children were Mitred and Armed before they came out of their Wombs. Such were the thoughts of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who was ſo mad for a Son, onely to make him marry <hi>Roſuald</hi>'s Daughter, his Ward, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe to obteine ſome ſpirituall Benefices for her Brother, and ſo make him renounce the inheritance, which he intended to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne family by meanes of her marriage with his Son. Thoſe that are laviſh ſpenders, are glad to meet with Eſtates gotten to their hands, without any trouble or pain of theirs, for they naturally hate frugality. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> who was of this humour, relyed abſolutely upon the wealth of <hi>Roſuald,</hi> his predeceſſor in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and Intereſt of whoſe Eſtate he ſplendidly mainteined all his train, without touching the main ſtock, whereof he could not diſpoſe without prejudice to his Wards. But becauſe this Lamprey might in time ſlip out of his hand, he determined to take a Fig-leaf, that is, to contract an Alliance whereby he might gain the full poſſeſſion of that mighty Eſtate, and make himſelf enter upon the labours and acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Predeceſſor. And in regard that the want of years in both Parties, might give occaſion to the kindred of his Wards (already much diſpleaſed that he had raviſhed the Gardianſhip out of their hands) to endeavour to render invalid this Alliance, through the default of a mutuall conſent, which is the principall knot of Matrimony, he obteined from the King a permiſſion for them to marry in their Childhood, or at leaſt to contract them ſo that the meanes could not be taken out of his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>This was in agitation before <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was five yeares old: And <hi>Aretuza</hi> being not well pleaſed to ſee that a ſuppoſed Child ſhould reap, before the ſeaſon, that which ſhe, as well as <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> deſired to preſerve in their owne family, taking the opportunity of a whole year's time her Husband was abſent, ſhe ſent the falſe <hi>Iphigenes</hi> home to his Mother, and took the reall one into her own tuition, giving <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> (who had brought her up from the Cradle) the conduct and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her, to the end that he ſhould help to conceale that which ſhe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51476:14"/> would not have <hi>Mieſlas</hi> know, and that he might ſee her learn all the recommendable qualities and exerciſes requiſite for a Gentleman of ſuch Extraction, (Permit that we ſpeak of her hence forwards, as a Male, ſince her Mother will have it ſo, and her Father thinks her ſo.) Herein <hi>Aretuza</hi> was ſerved as faithfully as ſhe could deſire in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſso tickliſh and dangerous, that ſhe ran no leſs hazard then of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her own life, if <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ſhould diſcover the deceipt, who at his return found his Son ſo beautifull (for it was a little Angel) that he was quite raviſhed. But if his Body was agreeable, believe it, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour domicile lodged a Wit that ſurpaſſed many degrees any of that growth: which augmented exceedingly the Father's joy, who ſtaying very little at home (being for the moſt part either viſiting his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or called to Court, or ſent upon ſome Military expedition for defence of his Country) injoyed but ſeldome and ſhort whiles the ſight of his dear Son, who was the light and delight of his Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had ſcarce yet ſeen eight years in the World, when hee was marryed (God knows how) to <hi>Modeſtina, (Roſuald's</hi> Daughter, and Ward to <hi>Mieſlas</hi>) who deſerved that name for her incomparable <hi>Modeſty;</hi> ſhe was ſo much elder then <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as that the Husband and Wife could make up eighteen years between them. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> (being of a magnificent humour) invited the greateſt part of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry of his <hi>Palatinate</hi> to the Wedding, which was celebrated with all the delights and greateſt Pomp imaginable; But one Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he cauſed to be done, was very needleſs, which was to make a Venerable Matron lye betwixt the marryed Couple, leſt they ſhould approach each other in the Night. This Prudent caution of his would have made <hi>Aretuza</hi> laugh heartily, if her continuall apprehenſion, that the ſecret would be diſcovered, had not held her in the ſame tranſe that kept <hi>Damocles</hi> from eating at the Tyrant of <hi>Sicilie</hi>'s table. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante, Modeſtina</hi>'s onely Brother, was deſtined by <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to be a Church-man, to the end that by that <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Leviticall</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, his Siſter might remain ſole Inheritrix of <hi>Roſuald</hi>'s Eſtate, and the whole Patrimony come to <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> This was the <hi>Palatine's</hi> plot; but <hi>Liante</hi> being high-ſirited and of a <hi>Martiall</hi> diſpoſition, took more delight in Arms, than at his Book, and was more ambitious of wearing a Sword than a <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s Caſſack. Nevertheleſs as Trees, which are young, may be bended which way the Maſter pleaſeth; the ſame is commonly done with Children, who are like a blank paper or a piece of wax, whereon a man may make what impreſſion he deſireth.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51476:14"/> At length the Benefice was procured, the Gown ready, the poor Youth made to put it on by threatnings, or by flatteries, although with a thouſand repugnancies, a thouſand heavy groans, and whole ſtreams of tears. Beſides his own Tyrannicall authority <hi>Mieſlas</hi> made uſe of the <hi>King</hi>'s name, after the cuſtome of many great Perſons, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the People with this pretext, and cover all their paſſions under the robe of their Sovereign, whoſe word &amp; power they abuſe with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity and inſolence. Thus the two Wards were bred up with his two youngeſt Children, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Clemencia;</hi> for the four precedent Daughters, like the four monſtruous Creatures of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> he had commanded to be tyed to the Chariot of <hi>God's</hi> glory, (that is) had thruſt them into Monaſteries, there to draw the Ark; where we ill leave them, as it were, condemned to perpetuall impriſonment, to ſee the ſucceſſes that arrived, upon the theater of the World, to the two Wards and <hi>Mieſlas</hi> his two other Children, who make the four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts in the Muſick of this Narration.</p>
               <p>The married Couple (ſuch as I have repreſented them to you) loved like Children; <hi>Liante</hi> ſuffered (as well as he could) the Yoke which he was forced yet to bear, but built a reſolution within himſelf to ſhake it off, and fly our of his Cage as ſoon as Age had given him wings: <hi>Clemencia</hi> was deſigned by <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to acquire him a Son in law of ſome great fortune, or at the worſt, to keep her Siſters company in the Cloyſter. Theſe four Children being brought up together in one houſe, fed at the ſame Table, playing and ſpending the time alwaies together, lived like Brothers and Siſters with a pretty intelligence cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the innocence of their age and humours. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> by the induſtry of his Governour <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> lived untill eleven or twelve years old, in ſuch ſimplicity, that he thought really he as a Boy, not conceiving that there was any other difference betwixt Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male than their manner of cloathing. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> fearing that, if he ſhould permit his Son too ſoon to conſummate his Marriage, that might be prejudiciall to his health (ſeeing him of a complexion and ſtature more delicate than robuſt) appointed a Governeſs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> fitly named <hi>Perpetua,</hi> for ſhe was perpetually at her back, caſting an <hi>Argu</hi>'s eye over all her actions, leſt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> at any time ſhould ſteal thoſe Rights which Husbands have priviledge to challenge; But Nature had already provided other obſtacles. They loved each other however very much, whether out of reſemblance of their diſpoſitions, or whether through that naturall inclination which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51476:15"/> induceth us to affect thoſe of the ſame Sex, as well as to be paſſionate for thoſe of the contrary; Yet this affection betwixt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Modeſtina</hi> was rather <hi>friendſhip</hi> than <hi>love.</hi> But when Nature playing her part (which is ſo difficult a thing to hinder) carried <hi>Iphigenes</hi> fancy to delight in working and ſuch Womaniſh amuſements, buſying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very eagerly with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> and <hi>Clemencia;</hi> then his diſcreet Governour making him aſhamed of ſuch feminine employments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his thoughts to the practice of Manly actions, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Sex, of which the Innocent Youth yet thought himſelf, whoſe condition being more free, ſeemed to him far more deſirable than that ſubjection wherein Maids and Women live. So that having an excellent wit, and a Body very active, though not robuſt, in every exerciſe whereunto he applyed himſelf, he became an admirable profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>It was nothing ſo in the vocation which <hi>Liante</hi> was compelled to embrace; for it is very difficult to become learned in deſpight of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and to garniſh the Soul with the pretious furniture of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Sciences, if one have not ſome inclination to ſtudy, this young Noble-man being wrapped up (againſt his will) in an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick's Gown, meditated nothing but exerciſes contrary to that habit, Armes, Horſes, Dancing, Hunting, and Warlike exploits were the onely delicious entertainments of his thoughts, all other diſcourſe was irkſome to his eares. This Conſtraint (under which Hee groaned, as if his Soul had been upon the Rack, and his Heart under the torture of a preſs) made him ſo melanchollie and penſive, that Hee ſeemed to traile the houres of his life with regret in an unpleaſant Apprentiſhip. During this diſcontent, hee hatched a ſecret, but furious hatred againſt his inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Guardian, conſidering him as the raviſher of his Eſtate, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his liberty, and the Oppreſſor of his free-Birth, projecting not onely to eſcape (as ſoon as hee could) but ſtudying notorious reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for reparation of the injuries hee received. As for <hi>Clemencia</hi> ſhe was yet ſo young, that the innocence of her years exempted her from Care or any paſſions of the mind; but it is with Youth as with a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, It is no ſooner budded, in a manner, but 'tis full blown, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Women, and chiefly in the Daughters of great Perſons; for this Sex being naturally more ſubtile, they ſooner do put off their Childiſhneſs than Men; beſides thoſe of high Births are brought up with ſuch care &amp; quaintneſs that their Wits are often ripe before the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their years requires it; whence it proceeds that they are ſooner
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51476:15"/> ſuſceptible of thoſe Touches and Tyes of Affection which make young hearts ſeem to have paſt their Childhood.</p>
               <p>In the full eaſe of this ſweet education <hi>Modeſtina</hi> modeſtly longed after the fruition of her beautifull, but as yet too young Husband; Her flames were ſo pure, and her deſires ſo juſt, that (if <hi>Aretuza</hi>'s deceipt had not abuſed her exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctation) me thinks her wiſhes might without ſhame appear upon theſe leaves, whoſe Paper is leſs white then the Candor of thoſe paſſions which ſhall be repreſented in this Volume. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in like manner beginning to reflect upon himſelfe, and who had no other propertie of Marble than the whiteneſs, grew into a pretty kind of indignation, that (being married) hee ſhould be deprived of the poſſeſſion of his Wife; and ſeeing himſelfe paſſionately beloved of <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (who gave him all the civill teſtimonies of affection She could imagine) He muſt not only have renounced all Humanity, but have been altogether inſenſible, if hee had not been moved thereat; no charm being ſo powerfull to make one bee beloved, as vehemently to love. If whiles they were at their innocent childiſh ſports they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed any kind embraces or affectionate words, their diſcours was ſoon broken by the preſence of their two <hi>Arguſſes, Boleſlaüs</hi> &amp; <hi>Perpetua,</hi> whoſe thoughts (though different) arrived both at the ſame end, which was to hinder (that which never could be effected) the Conſummation of their Marriage; <hi>Perpetua</hi> being encharged by <hi>Mieslas</hi> was very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant to oppoſe it, leſt his Son's health might be prejudiced thereby; and <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> having received the Command from <hi>Aretuza,</hi> was no leſs cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect for feare her deceipt ſhould bee diſcovered. Oh who could imagine any thing but purity in the innocent kiſſes and tender embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe two lovely Creatures, who like the twin kids in the <hi>Canticles</hi> did feed among the Lillies? Hee that would be ſcandalized to ſee two hen-doves join their bills, the union of the blooming Roſe with the Morning dew, or the beams of the Sun when he licks the Chryſtall of the Waters, might knit his brow at this innocent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and exerciſe the malicious ſeverity of his peeviſh melancholly, like a ſnaile that ſullieth with is ſlimy train the delightfull enamell of the moſt curious flowers.</p>
               <p>If the agreeable <hi>Iphigenes</hi> bare much Love to his no leſs loving wife, Nature by waies as ſecret as unknown to him, bred in him as much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards his brother in-law <hi>Liante,</hi> and although his ſullen and diſcontented humor rendred him very unſociable, and by conſequent leſs amiable, it cannot be ſaid how hee delighted in his converſation,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51476:16"/> how much hee endeavoured to divert him. On the other ſide <hi>Liante</hi> (who looked upon <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> not as his Siſter's Husband, but as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie's Son, as the uſurper of his Fortunes, and one whoſe greatneſs was eſtabliſhed upon him ruines; Notwithſtanding all theſe thoughts, whereby hee excited himſelf to Choller and Hatred like a Lyon that whets his fury by ſcourging his ſides with his own tail) could not conceive any averſion againſt him, whether the ſweetneſs of his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition charmed him; whether his kindneſs, his complements, and his compliance to his humor won his heart; whether his beauty joyned with his gracefull deportment raviſhed him? or whether (which is moſt probable) the <hi>Senſe</hi> bent his inclinations naturally towards this Object, for reaſons which I had rather leave to conjecture than conſign to this writing; Hee could not chooſe but love <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> although in appearance hee ſeemed much remiſs, and rather ſenſible of his injuries than ſuſceptible of affection. This cold reſervedneſs increaſed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> heat (according to the diſpoſition of that sex, who are commonly moſt paſſionate for thoſe who do care leaſt for them) inſomuch that the more <hi>Linate</hi> ſeemed to ſight him, the more hee redoubled his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and courteſies, as if hee had undertaken by the vigour of an ardent flame to diſſolve the Iſicles that environed his frozen Heart. At firſt <hi>Liante,</hi> whom Melanchollie had made miſtruſtfull, fancied that thoſe marks of friendſhip were but feined, and proceeded from ſome artificiall Counſell or Plot to make him conſent willingly to the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Eſtate in favour of his Siſter <hi>Modeſtina</hi>'s marriage: But having perceived by the perſeverance, that pur Inclination, not Intereſt or Pretenſions, moved <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to affect him, Hee opened his heart more to him, complaining of the Rigour and Injuſtice of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who forced him to embrace a vocation whereunto hee was no way diſpoſed. This juſt diſcontent found in the ſoul of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> an humour ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compaſſionate, that although in all his diſcourſe hee obſerved the reſpect which hee owed his Father, yet hee freely condemned his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, proteſting to <hi>Linate,</hi> what deſign ſoever <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had in marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with <hi>Modestina,</hi> that hee would never take of his inheritance any other Portion than what hee would pleaſe to give his Siſter, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it very unreaſonable that a younger Siſter ſhould not only make (as ſhe liſted) a Portion for her elder, and only Brother, but deprive him abſolutely of his Patrimony, in obedience to a ſuperior Power that would carry all away by main force: That if the condition of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick was not conformable to his humour, there was a poſſibility
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51476:16"/> to ſatisfie him, and content likewiſe the greedy pretenſions of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> by making a double alliance, and giving to him in marriage his Siſter <hi>Clemencia,</hi> with ſo much of the Eſtate as belonged to him by his Father's death; being more willing for his own part to live a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gentleman, remitting his Fortune to his perſonall valour and the point of his Sword, reſerving to himſelf only Hope (which was <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s portion) than to poſſeſs unjuſtly another's means with continuall Remorſes and internall Reproaches. Theſe Reaſons ſo conquered <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante</hi>'s heart, that thence-forwards all his affections hee thought too little for <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> whom hee began to conſider as his Redeemer, as one who breaking his Iron bonds was to releaſe him out of the hands of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and free him from the houſe of Bondage.</p>
               <p>Covetouſneſs is a diſeaſe which reigns but little among young unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced People, who think (as the Proverb goes) that the World will never be at an end with them; The deſire of pleaſures, liberty and vanity, torments them infinitely more; All that oppoſes this Torrent, ſeems to turn the courſe of their Nature, and reduce them to deſpair. This made <hi>Liante</hi> (building an entire confidence on his Brother-in-law <hi>Iphigenes</hi>) declare unto him that the Regret which undermined him, and led him inſenſibly to the grave, was not ſo much for the loſs of his Eſtate (which hee eſteemed well beſtowed, ſeeing it fell into ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hands) as to ſee himſelf bound up in a Caſſock, and ingaged in a manner of life which denyed him the uſe of Arms, whereunto his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination called him, and whither all his Ambition tended; for War was his Element, where hee would rather chooſe to meet an honorable death, then lead a ſweet, plentifull and peaceable life in the moſt rich and eminent Dignities of the Church, to the honors whereof hee never would pretend, not perceiving himſelf called thereunto like <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is, by a good and Royall way. <hi>Brother</hi> (replyed <hi>Iphigenes) take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſuffer not Melanchollie to or'e-maſter or diſtemper you, preſerve your ſelf for generous enterpriſes; If you have a mind to take wing, and leave this neſt of ſluggiſhneſs, I have no leſs deſire than you to ſeek in Militarie adventures the Laurells that grow in</hi> Mars'<hi>s field; therefore let's goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, let's ſteale away ſome favourable Night, and enter into the harveſt of glorie in thoſe places where Cowards dare not appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words revived the afflicted <hi>Liante,</hi> who was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the inevitable charms of <hi>Iphigenes</hi>'s Countenance and Converſation, that hee could live no more without him, being in his abſence like a Marigold when the Sun hath left its Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51476:17"/> For as that flower doth cloſe its leaves, when it is deprived of the aſpect of that glorious Planet, ſo <hi>Liante,</hi> when ſeperated from <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> was overwhelmed with ſadneſs, in ſuch ſort, that Hee ſeemed to bee rather a fenſleſs Statue than a living Creature. Oh how it grieved him to bee divided in his exerciſes from him, to whom his heart was ſo united by inclination! To bee called to his ſtudie was death to him, but if for divertiſement his Maſter permitted him to ſee the riding of the great Horſe, fencing, dancing, vaulting, and other exerciſes (which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> learned with as much care on his Parent's part, as dexteritie and aptneſs on his own) hee applyed his Spirits with ſuch attention to them, that for a good while after hee could think on nothing elſe: if hee handled a foile, hee did it with ſuch a grace, if hee Jumped, it was with ſuch activeneſs, that it was eaſie to judge hee was as much in his Element at thoſe recreations, as hee was out of it when his Spirits were tormented with the thorns of the Grammer. One time it hapned that complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his dear Brother-in-law of the oruell Martyrdome which hee was made to ſuffer at his Book, and how he abhorred that long robe hee was compelled to wear, gret drops of tears, like ſo many Pearls, ran down his face from the Orient of his Eyes: This ſight ſo mollified the tender heart of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (who was of a Sex that hath tears at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) that mingling his with <hi>Liante</hi>'s, hee fell on his face, and caſting his arms about his neck, hee gave him manie loving, yet innocent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, which <hi>Liante</hi> received with ſuch motions of joy and ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as ſurpaſs the tearms of any expreſſion; then with an incomparable harmleſſneſs they interchanged ſome kiſſes, wherein the malignitie of Nature put ſome difference by certain ardours, which are not found in thoſe that paſs betwixt perſons of the ſame ſex, both of them feeling themſelves tranſported with a certain pleaſure and raviſhment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Cauſe was yet unknown to them, but which proceeded from the treachery of <hi>Love,</hi> diſguiſed under the appearance of Brotherly <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> Seeing that this intimacie increaſed more and more betwixt the two Brothers, was afraid leſt thoſe Careſſes and familiaritie ſhould paſs to ſuch tearms as might diſcover to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> that of which (through his induſtrie and vigilancie) Hee was yet ignorant concerning himſelf. <hi>Aretuza</hi> never ſaw them together without unſpeakable heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beatings &amp; trembling, for ſhee thought her husband would never pardon her, if hee ſhould come to the knowledg of the deceipt, whereby ſhe had abuſed and amuſed him ſo long time; Beſides ſhe feared leſt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> honour might bee intereſſed through Ignorance, though not Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51476:17"/> Inſomuch by this perplexity of thoughts her Mind did feel no leſs convulſions and pangs, than a Woman in travell endureth in her Body. Whileſt ſhee was in this trouble, the Union of the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's hearts grew to ſuch a perfection, that it ſeemed as if there had been but one Soul in their two Bodies; the ſame No, and the ſame Yea comming at the ſame inſtant out of their Mouths. You could never ſee the one without the other, if they were ſeparated; their parting was never without tears. <hi>Modestina</hi> was already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in a manner nothing with <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Liante,</hi> and if ſhee had been of a jealous diſpoſition, ſhee had cauſe enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that her Brother withdrew the affection of her ſweet Husband from her, but ſhe imputed that rather to Childiſhneſs then any thing elſe, imagining that aſſoon as <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was advanced ſomewhat more towards Man-hood, ſhe ſhould eaſily turn the courſe of his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in mean time having opened <hi>Liante</hi>'s eyes for his Siſter <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencia,</hi> was not contented to have put, or to have begun to put the fire into his breſt, if he conveyed not all the flame into his Siſter's heart, to whom hee gave ſuch a Character of the vertues, gracefulneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his dear <hi>Liante,</hi> that in ſhort time that ſpark grew to ſo furious a blaze, that it was neer reducing her to aſhes; Hee had ſo framed the way to her Mind, that ſhe was taken on a ſuddain, according to the Nature of certain ſubtile fire which takes ſooner and more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in green wood than in drie, and whoſe firſt burning is alwaies the moſt violent. There was no compariſon betwixt <hi>Clemeneia</hi>'s paſſion and <hi>Liante</hi>'s, for hee poſſeſſed far more attractive qualities to make him bee beloved of her, than ſhee had to captivate his liberty: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Love</hi> being an Appetite which tends to the production of it's like, it is no wonder (as a Torch that's burning doth eaſily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it's light to one that's out) if <hi>Love</hi> firſt begets another <hi>Love</hi> in the heart beloved, ſince to wiſh well doth almoſt of neceſſity challenge a reciprocall well-wiſhing. The Paleneſs, which ſoon took up its ſeat on <hi>Clementia</hi>'s cheeks; The looks, meſſengers of her paſſions, which ſent glances as ſuppliants to <hi>Liante</hi>'s eyes; The delight ſhee ſeemed to receive in his coverſation; The regret ſhee felt for his abſence; The fear of diſcontenting him; The deſire of pleaſing him, and the exceeding contentment ſhee expreſſed in ſpeaking of him; All theſe prettie Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſymptomes ſpake her ſomewhat more than Child, and bringing her neer Woman-hood, changed the libertie of her Innocence into a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51476:18"/> whoſe chains did ſeem ſo golden and ſo ſweet to her, that ſhee thought ſhee never had taſted anie felicitie, but ſince the time ſhee had rendred her ſelf a prey to the amiable <hi>Liante</hi>'s charms.</p>
               <p>This Paſsion paſſing through her ear into her heart, &amp; being ingraven by the tongue of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as with an inſtrument of flame, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt of her thoughts, devoured or conſumed her ſo, that ſhee was readie to die of the wound, if her kind Brother (who had kindled the fire) had not applyed the remedie, by aſſuring her of the reciprocall affection of him whom hee had perſwaded her to love. <hi>Liante</hi> being acquainted herewith by <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (ingenious to hinder his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages) began by the gate of his Intereſt to receive ſome inclinations for <hi>Clemencia,</hi> conceiving that might bee a means for him to recover his Eſtate, and procure Honours: Afterwards ſeeing her ſo full of affection, that her too-much loving caſt her into a languiſhing for him, hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her deſires more out of Compaſſion than Paſſion, or rather for Pittie than Affection: for indeed ſhee had more ſweetneſs in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to mollifie, than Beautie in her face to attract the heart of the brave <hi>Liante.</hi> But the Conduct of theſe <hi>Amoretta</hi>'s required more judgement and diſcretion than the ſmall experience of ſuch tender years could promiſe; They were to deceive ſo many eyes that pryed inceſſantly into their actions, that it was too hard a task, Love (like a fire) being difficult to be kept hid within the Boſom; And yet if any one perceived the leaſt of this inteligence, all's loſt, all theſe Deſigns will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into ſmoak, all theſe Projects flie away with the wind. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had the dexteritie to manage this buſineſs with ſuch circumſpection, <hi>Liante</hi> had learnt to counterfeit with ſuch ſubtilitie, and <hi>Clemencia</hi> (aſſured of her Lover's mutuall flame) could diſſemble with ſo much conſtancie (that ſex having a great empire over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when there is a neceſſitie of feining) that they practiced for a good while, this commerce of <hi>Love,</hi> without diſcovering but very weak ſparkles of their fire. What cannot this Paſſion do when it refineth and ſubtilizeth thus ſuch young Souls! Obſerve but how it brings to School again all the Prudence of hoarie heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Modeſtina</hi> and <hi>Clemencia</hi> had but one Governeſs, but the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law had ſeverall Conducters, in regard they were applyed to different exerciſes; yet neither <hi>Liante</hi>'s Maſter, nor <hi>Perpetua</hi> perceived any thing of this ſecret correſpondence betwixt <hi>Clemencia</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Clergie-Man;</hi> ſo attentive was ſhee to hinder <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51476:18"/> 
                  <hi>Modeſtina</hi>'s private communication, and ſo handſomly did <hi>Liante</hi> with his ordinarie ſadneſs hide from his Over-ſeer his affectionate pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Only <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who watching like a Dragon, that never ſhuts his eyes, to preſerve the ſecret of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> obſerved that the great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity 'twixt him and <hi>Liante,</hi> put in evident danger of beeing revealed all the Myſterie which hee had till then concealed with ſo much care; and fearing leſt <hi>Liante</hi> rather than <hi>Modeſtina</hi> ſhould diſcover what kind of man <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was, had a ſerious conference thereupon with <hi>Aretuza,</hi> who jumping with his opinion, thought it moſt expedient to ſingle out <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and declare unto her all the paſſages of her birth and education, to the end that ſeeing her ſelf obliged under pain of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her life (which puniſhment ſhee could not eſcape by diſcovering her ſelf, no more than <hi>Aretuza</hi>) to keep this ſecret, and ſo to demean her ſelf, that living with the libertie of Males, Shee might no way blemiſh the honour of her ſex: Neceſſity (which is a very harſh Miſtres) made them embrace his reſolution, and it was no ſooner concluded than put in execution.</p>
               <p>To tell you the aſtoniſhment that ſeized <hi>Iphigenes</hi> at the recitall of his own ſtorie, would bee too difficult an enterpriſe; Hee thought that hee either dreamt, or was inchanted, and hardly could give credit to his ears and eyes. The joy that the Maydens had or might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, being transformed into Men (as ſome Hiſtories make mention) may make us conceive ſome ſhadow of that ſadneſs, which ſtruck <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> heart, when hee ſaw himſelf fallen from that degree of glorie, whereunto hee fancied the condition of being a <hi>Man,</hi> might have raiſed him. Hee could hardly refrain from falling out with thoſe that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeled his eyes with the Medicine of their advertiſement, and who had diſpoſſeſſed him (like <hi>Traſimenes</hi> cured of his follie) of that ſweet errour which contented him. Hee apprehended to be reduced to that, almoſt ſervile, Subjection of the female Sex, having by Cuſtome made Nature of the libertie which Men enjoy. What? ſhall this <hi>Amazon</hi> change her Sword and Lance for a Needle and a Diſtaff? ſhall ſhee leave ſo many noble Exerciſes, wherein her generous Spirit took ſuch pleaſure, to ſit conſtantly in a Chamber, tricking up her ſelf, and conſulting with her looking-glaſſes how to enſnare &amp; inflame lover'<hi>s</hi> hearts? What? in ſtead of having the Empire and command over Men, ſhall ſhe be reformed to the ſubmiſſion and obedience, that is the only portion and propertie of Women? No, ſuch a reſolution is leſs ſupportable than death. Having been bred, the beginning of her daies, like a Man, ſhee will end them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51476:19"/> like a Souldier, and ſeek in the bed of Honor an heroick Death, ſince ſhee hath loſt the hope of a happy life. But this reſolution is too extream; there's a remedie for every thing but dying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aretuza</hi> flattered, and (as a Mother) conjured her ſhee-Son not to diſcloſe himſelf. <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> to ſecond her, beſeeched him to have pittie on his gray hairs, and not to haſten his journie to the grave, by paying with too unworthy an ingratitude his faithfull ſervices, repreſenting that upon him (who had been the Manager and Concealer of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt) <hi>Mieſlas</hi> would chiefly diſcharge the burthen of his furie, if that Myſterie ſhould come to his knowledg. Moreover, that the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they gave him, was not to oblige him to change neither manner of life nor habit, or to leave the exerciſes of Chivalrie, wherein his Courage and Activity gained the admiration of everie one: But quite contrarie they deſired him to continue them with more eagerneſs, and to feine himſelf to bee a Man the more, the leſs hee knew it. That Time might produce ſome expedient means to gain his father's heart wihtout hazarding the lives of ſo manie perſons, and in ſtead of <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (who could not bee his wife, by reaſon of thoſe obſtacles which nature had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed) hee might lawfully injoy <hi>Liante</hi> as a Husband, ſo that ſome one of their Children bare the Name and Arms of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> whereby his intention would not bee altogether fruſtrated in the Alliance which hee projected with the houſe of <hi>Roſuald.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judg how great the advnatages of <hi>Love</hi> are above the Senſe of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> This laſt Clauſe which ingendred ſome Hope in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to ſee herſelf united by marriage to the beloved <hi>Liante,</hi> effaced almoſt in an inſtant that incomparable ſorrow that dejected her at firſt, ſeeing her ſelf fallen from a quality ſo honourable and advnatagious, as that of <hi>Man.</hi> Inſomuch that immediately changing the <hi>Love</hi> ſhee bare <hi>Modeſtina</hi> into a pure <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and the entire <hi>Friendſhip</hi> ſhee had contracted with <hi>Liante,</hi> into a fervent <hi>Love,</hi> but vertuous, (ſince that it juſtified it ſelf by the deſign of a chaſt Matrimony;) ſhee perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated a Man better then ever, betook her ſelf to her Military execiſes again with more eagerneſs, &amp; looking upon <hi>Liante</hi> with other eyes than of a Brother-in-law, Shee treated him with more reſervedneſs, deducting ſomewhat from the liberty of a <hi>Man,</hi> to add to the moderation of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> to whom Pudicity ought to be more precious than Life. O how much did ſhee repent her poſſeſſing <hi>Clemencia</hi> with ſo much Love for <hi>Liante,</hi> whereby ſhee had made her Siſter her Rival, and kindled a fire which ſhee ought rather to have quencht, and which thence-forwards
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51476:19"/> ſhee promiſed her ſelf to ſmother by all the induſtrie her invention could ſuggeſt. As for <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (whoſe friendſhip obliged her to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall affection) ſhee feined to be more paſſionate for her than ever, and the better to act the Husband, Shee made a ſhew of deſiring with much ardour the poſſeſſion of her wife, being by that time neer fifteen years of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perpetua</hi> wrote to <hi>Mieſlas</hi> (then at Court) that ſhee ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined to ſuffer, what ſhee could no longer hinder, and that if <hi>Iphige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> would make uſe of <hi>Modeſtina</hi> as her Husband, <hi>Modeſtina</hi> had no leſs deſire to ſerve him as his Wife. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> who had deſired nothing more than the accompliſhment of that marriage, out of an odd fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call humor would not conſent to the Conſummation, but delayed it from day to day untill his return into <hi>Podolia.</hi> But being not able to obtein leave from the King (who finding him very fit for the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging great affairs, had every day ſome new imployment for him) Hee bethought himſelf to ſend for his Son to the Court, (which is the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of young Nobility,) where hee would preſent him to the King, and make him appear according to his quality. This Command ſomewhat troubled <hi>Aretuza</hi> at the firſt; but <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> quickly perſwaded her to condeſcend to that which ſhee could not oppoſe, promiſing her to watch ſo carefully over the deportments of his Nurſling, that ſhee ſhould receive neither reproach nor diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>This news was diverſly received among our yuong Lovers, all their four hearts did feele at the ſame inſtant very different aſſualts. For <hi>Modeſtina</hi> preſſed with the juſt impatiences of a marriageable Virgin, that expects till the maturity of a too-tender husband makes her both Wife and Mother, could not endure to thik of loſing the ſight of her Angel like husband, who was more the life of her Soul, then her Soul the life of her Body. To regiſter her Sighs, her Groans, and her Tears, were no more eaſie than to number the puffs of winde in <hi>Autumn,</hi> the parching minutes of Summer, and the drops of rain in Winter. How Modeſt ſoever ſhee was in heart, as well as by name, her exceeding Love turning to Folly, and that Folly into Rage and Deſpair, made her commit Immodeſties, which could be excuſed by nothing but the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Wife and Lover. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſeeing her in this condition, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, that it ſeemed the ſtroak of Death had been more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, than to ſee her ſelf deprived of the light of his eyes, and plunged in the darkneſs of the Eclipſe of that deteſted Abſence, was touched with ſuch tender reſentments of ſorrow, that Hee had much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51476:20"/> ado by falling in a Traunce to keep himſelf from diſcovering that in his body there was a <hi>womaniſh</hi> weakneſs hidden under the habit of a <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this affection of compaſſion was nothing in compariſon of the torment which ſhee felt, when ſhee came to think of her Separation from <hi>Liante:</hi> For ſince ſhee had the knowledge of her ſelf, having put (as it were) a bar betwixt thoſe familiarities and privacies with him that might have hurt, or any way blemiſhed her honour, by this reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſmart was become more painfull, and the fire of her breſt (like that in a narrow fornace) was rendred the more ardent, the more it was ſuppreſt. All her fear was, that the ignorance of her Sex, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Shee muſt leave <hi>Liante,</hi> and the continuall preſence of <hi>Clemencia,</hi> in whoſe affection Shee had ingaged him, with the help of her abſence, would raviſh from her that heart, which was the aym of all her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, &amp; the golden Fleece whereunto aſpired her moſt deſired Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. <hi>Clemencia</hi> (who remained at home with no leſs paſſion for <hi>Liante,</hi> than <hi>Iphigenes</hi> carried with her to Court, yet covered the Coals of her deſire with the aſhes of Diſcretion &amp; Silence) was in an extream pain for the abſence of her Brother, in whom Shee loſt a faithfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of her thoughts: Yet promiſing her ſelf to ſupply that want with the Pen, which ſhould ſerve to convey her conceptions to him, and likewiſe his to her, Shee was the leſs afflicted for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But the grief of the diſconſolate <hi>Liante,</hi> was not ſo eaſily pacified; for feeling himſelf bound to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with bonds which hee could not comprehend, and ſuch ſtrong ones as could not bee broken, hee did like the <hi>Cimmerians,</hi> who cry and groan when the Sun leaves their Countrie, as if theywere never to ſee it any more: Hee felt his very bowells rend within him at this Seperation: And as <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who had ſo much deſired to be a Mother, repented her of her wiſh when She felt the pains that her two Children ſtrugling together in her womb did make her ſuffer: So <hi>Liante</hi> could almoſt have wiſhed that hee had never ſeen, nor loved <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſince that ſweet Friendſhip produced ſo cruel a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as thoſe who are troubled with worms, which ingender in the head or th' Entrails, endure ſtrange indiſpoſitions, without knowing the cauſe that doth afflict them; So this young Gentleman feeling that Viper, <hi>Love,</hi> which gnawed his heart under the appearance of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> did ſuffer a far more penetrating ſmart for his being parted from that beloved Object, than any one is accuſtomed to feel for the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51476:20"/> abſence of a friend. For <hi>Friendſhip</hi> doth kindle in the Soule a fire more ſober and moderate than <hi>Love,</hi> whoſe flames are more fierce and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Was it not enough</hi> (ſaid hee within himſelfe) <hi>that wee were ſeparated in conditions and exerciſes, without dividing by ſuch a diſtance thoſe whoſe hearts are ſo united, that they are as the</hi> Unitie <hi>it ſelf? To whom ſhall I have recourſe hence-forwards in my diſcontents? Who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace mee in my ſadneſſes? Who ſhall ſupport and revive my decayed hopes? O my dear Brother, you are my onely ſtay, my ſecond Soul, the light of mine Eyes; Abſent from you, I ſhall never ſee the day more without pain; and the life (if it may be called life) that I ſhall lead, will be a continuall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to mee. Yet if I might bee but ſuffered to follow you, I ſhould eſteem my ſelf too happie; but I am born under too unfortunate a Planet, to be otherwiſe than perſecuted to the extremitie by Diſaſters. Would to God there were no other obſtacle than my paſſlng over all the intereſt I pretend in my Father's Estate, according to the covetous pretenſions of</hi> Mieſlas, <hi>and that I might injoy the felicity but to wait on you as your ſervant; Indeed I prefer the meaneſt condition about your perſon before all the riches of the Earth, that ſweet ſervitude before any Liberty. O</hi> Mieſlas! <hi>why cannot you read my thoughts? why can you not ſee my intentions? I doe not think you ſo void of Humanity, as to keep mee any longer in this tortune, if you knew my heart.</hi>

               <p>Theſe Complaints recall to my remembrance the fable of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation betwixt the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Boreas,</hi> which ſhould firſt make the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller put off his Cloak; at laſt the one did by the gentle heat of his rayes, what the other could not accompliſh with his impetuous bluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The Poets have reaſon to feine, and their cozen-germans the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to picture <hi>Love</hi> naked, ſince his Power is far more prevalent to make a man ſtrip himſelf of his Eſtate than are <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Rigor.</hi> But if I ſhould ſtand to relate all the diſcourſes of theſe young Lovers, I ſhould never get out of this Farewell. To conclude, they were torn by Violence out of each other's Arms, and the ſtreams that ran from all their Eyes, did make a little Ocean of Tears, yet this deluge could not drown all their Sorrows. I could borrow ſome penſills of the Poets to give the Colours to this Departure, were I not unwilling to retard the greedy curioſity of the Reader, who deſires to be ſpeedily informed of the good and evill adventures of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>PHIGENES</hi> was no ſooner arrived at the Court, with an equipage ſuteable to the humour and quality of his Father, but the Eyes of all the Courtiers and Ladies were fixt upon this new Sun, which riſing upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon of that Climat, filled it with the ſplendor of his Rayes, caſting ſuch fiery glances, and ſo penetrating a light, that it was hard for any (if not blind) to avoid the ſcorching of his preſence. The Spring is not adorned with ſo many flowers, nor <hi>Titan</hi>'s glorious Orb with ſo many beams, as hee diſplayed Beauties and attractive Graces: All his Actions, his looks, his words, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, his exerciſes, were as many Charms that inchanted the hearts of all thoſe that did contemplate him. The attribute of <hi>Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> was preſently given him by the common conſent of both Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Ladies, and hee was uſually called <hi>The beautifull Podolian.</hi> To ſee him and to bee in love with him were two things that followed each other, as the Lightning and Thunder are obſerved to do: And thoſe that knew him but by reputation only cheriſhed his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51476:21"/> for beſides his dexteritie in thoſe Exercifes, which Courtiers hold for vertues, as Singing, Dancing, Vaulting, Managing a horſe with activitie and a grace, handling well his Arms, and having a good Garb, His Language was ſo ſmooth, his Diſpoſition ſo ſweet, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments ſo indeering, his Converſation ſo winning (eſpecially amongſt the Ladies) his Modeſtie ſo remarkable, his Chaſtitie, ſo extraordinarie in a Courtier, his Diſcretion ſo exquiſite, his Courage ſo undaunted, his Tongue ſo moderate, his Geſture ſo well compoſed, his Generoſity ſo ſplendid, his Liberality ſo magnificent, ſuch Decency in his apparell, a Sternneſs in his Armour, ſo ſweetly fierce, that it ſeemed as if <hi>Venus</hi> having taken poſſeſſion of his <hi>Face,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> of his Heart, and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity of the one, being tempered with the Gentleneſs of the other, had both conſpired to give him the Empire over all hearts either by <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi> It cannot bee imagined what ravage his beautifull face made in the Ladie's breſts, every one took him for an Angell deſcended from Heaven to ſet on fire all the daughters of Men; and what was moſt of all admired, was, to ſee, that this glorious Starre, like the Sunne, ingendred a thouſand flames, without having in himſelf, or (at leaſt) without making ſhew of any degree of heat, giving what he had not (that is) <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was during the winter (which is extremely rigorous in <hi>Polonia</hi>) a new diſeaſe ſo univerſally catching, that hardly any body did eſcape its malignity, it was called there the <hi>COKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVCHE:</hi> And in regard there were very few Ladies at Court that had not particular inclinations for <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and that ſpake not of him in tearms of admiration, a Wit of the Times called him the <hi>COKELVCHE</hi> of the Court. To this purpoſe a certain Lady ſaid, <hi>That to be in love with him was a thing indiſpenſable:</hi> Another anſwered a Gentleman that ſeemed to wonder at the ſo generall paſſions for this young Noble-man, ſaying, <hi>I believe you are either without Heart or Eyes.</hi> Hee was the Rock where their minds ſuffered ſhipwrack, few going with curioſity towards this Angelicall Object, but returned with a wound, or at leaſt with ſome diſtemper. How many young Ladies longed hee were their husband! how many Fathers and Mothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him for their Son-in-law! When it was known that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had already married him to <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> what ſorrow was expreſt! how many great and more advantageous matches were offred him, which made the greedy Father oft repent his haſtineſs, and he grew ſo proud to ſee his Son ſo well beloved, and ſo highly eſteemed, that he ſwam in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51476:22"/> ſatisfaction. And indeed hee that will fancy a moſt exquiſite feminine beauty, a delicate white complexion, ſweetly mixed with a lovely red, lively and ſparkling Eys, hair like Silk, and the reſt of thoſe attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that accompany that <hi>perfection</hi> which an Antient called an <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tyranny,</hi> and all this at the age of fifteen or ſixteen years under a man's habit (who cannot have ſo little beauty but 'tis much for that Sex) will find nothing ſtrange of all that hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Oh! how could I extend this Hiſtory if I ſhould ingage my Pen to the recitall of the ſeveral evenements that befell him upon this Account! That ſpecious form (which ſeemed to have been given him expreſsly to ruinate the pudicity of the moſt determinate and ſevere preſervers of their honour) how many aſſaults and ſtrange attempts did it make him ſuffer from thoſe Ladies that thought him of a contrary Sex! But I fear in publiſhing the impudence of thoſe ſhameleſs Souls, to call the baſhfull blood into more modeſt Faces, who cannot endure any thing, I will not ſay of Diſhoneſty (for I ſhould diſclaim my Pen if it were tainted with any impure Relation) but only tending to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Wits of the Court, whoſe invention is very pregnant in ſuch occurrences, know already more then I am able to imagine: others that are more ſimple ſhall remain (by my conſent) in the commendable ignorance of ſuch malicious practices.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe inconſiderate Lovers try in vain to draw into their Nets him who hath caught their Hearts, and who takes pleaſure in ſeeing them burn, like Flies, at the Fire of his eyes, Hee doth like thoſe Engineers, who caſt their artificiall fires all about, without receiving any dammage in their own perſons; or like thoſe Fountaineers, who ſhewing curious Water-works and <hi>Grotta's,</hi> where a thouſand little Pipes caſt water on every ſide, ſet themſelves in ſome known place where they remain dry, whilſt every one elſe is wetted to the skin. And as the ſecure Shepheards ſtanding to feed their flocks upon ſome eminent Hills neer the Sea-ſide, behold from thoſe firm and ſolid heights the toſſing and agitation of Ships beaten with ſtormy weather: So did Hee contemplate, in the weakneſs of thoſe ſpirits, ſo paſſionately enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored of him, the imbecillity of a Sex, which bred in him rather Pity than Envy, and Compaſſion rather than Love. It was not on that ſide that Hee feared being ſurpriſed, his naturall impotency rendring him moſt potent to reſiſt all thoſe temptations. On the other ſide the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive graces diſplay'd in the countenances of ſo many brave <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> (wherewith the Court was as glittering as the Heaven is with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51476:22"/> Stars in a cleer night) moved him as little; An honorable deſire of glory and the preſervation of his chaſtity being a powerfull bridle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aſſaults and ſurpriſes of the Senſe; beſides that his heart was ſo prepoſſeſt with love for <hi>Liante,</hi> that there was no room left to place any other Object: Moreover his humor was ſo averſe to vice and riotous deboſhing (which hee ſaw was the continuall practice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute companions) that their exceſſes made him rather ſhun than follow them, rather abhor the lewdneſs of their deportments, than fancy the handſomneſs of their perſons; pitying rather than envying their conditions: whereas on the contrary his vertue and handſomneſs were more envyed than pitied by them. Yea, for as the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> thoſe ſtinking and venemous Flies, do not ſettle but upon the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Flowers; So thoſe young <hi>Courtiers</hi> were grown miſchievouſly jealous, becauſe this new comer with his eminent beauty accompanied with ſweet diſpoſitions, and divers recommendable parts, came to do them the ſame affront as the Sun doth every morning to the meaner lights of Heaven, and raviſhed from them the hearts of all the Ladies, from whom they could no more receive any countenance, but ſlights. And, jealouſie being a fire, which hapning to kindle in an human ſoul, hindreth it (by reaſon of the vapors which it excites) from ſeeing the Sun of reaſon, they conſpired all together againſt <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and plotted how to ingage him in ſeverall quarrells.</p>
               <p>Already divers wicked Deſigns were layd to intrap his innocence, but the Preſerver of the vertuous ſtill delivered him: for the <hi>Courtiers</hi> (more changeable than the <hi>Sea</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> accommodating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the humour of the Times, more than the Fiſh, called the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypus,</hi> doth to the colour of the Rocks where it faſtens) have no other rule for their Hatred, or their Love, than their intereſt, and the meaſure of this Intereſt is the Humour of their <hi>Prince.</hi> Although thoſe who are moſt in the <hi>King's</hi> favour, are commonly the object of the People's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; yet the diſſembling complacency of the Court obligeth thoſe, who follow its wind and tyde, to applaud thoſe whom the <hi>Sovereign</hi> affects, notwithſtanding they hate them in their hearts, or at leaſt do not eſteem them. Beauty accompanied with a comely carriage is a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiſſion, which openeth the Cabinet and Heart of <hi>Kings;</hi> for they are but Men as well as others, and the more ſubject to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions becauſe elevated to an higher degree of Eminence, by the ſame reaſon that the talleſt Cedars ſuffer moſt by the wind's impetuouſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the loftieſt Towers feel oftneſt the effects of Thunder
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51476:23"/> and Lightning. And as the <hi>Elephants</hi> may be moſt eaſily wounded in the flank, which is the tendereſt part in their unweildy bodies (as ſeverall examples witneſs:) ſo great Perſons are no where ſo weak, nor ſo eaſily to be ſurpriſed by any thing as by paſſinate affections, this being their generall defect. And indeed it were a difficult matter for thoſe, who are beloved (I ſhould rather ſay) ſerved, adored and admired of ſo many deſerving perſons as are ſtill about them, not to be ſweetly enforced to render themſelves to the particular affection of ſome one; whence it follows that <hi>Favour</hi> is the inſeparable ſhadow of <hi>Royalty.</hi> For if the Sun, that lamp of the Univerſe, which from his Heavenly Chariot ſees all things upon Earth, looks with another eye (amongſt the flowers of a Garden-plot) upon the Marigold, and all other yellow flowers, which ſeem to be decked with the Gold of is ſplendent Rayes, and by that yellow livery do teſtifie the love they bear that glorious <hi>Luminary.</hi> So <hi>Kings</hi> who are the light of the World, and the Suns of the Earth, ſince 'tis from them that the moſt noble perſons of a State do borrow their luſtre, although they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their paternall care to all their ſubjects, as fathers of their People; yet in this generall ſolicitude they apply their Eyes and Ears to ſome particular ſervants, who by that means get ground in the territory of their hearts, and do rule the ſpirits of their <hi>Kings</hi> by the ſweetneſs of friendſhip, as the <hi>Kings</hi> by the force of authority do reign over the Provinces under their ſubjection. And above all, <hi>Beauty</hi> hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to eſtabliſh her Empire with ſuch polite and quaint indeerments, that whereas all other ſubjection is irkſom, here Liberty is odious, and Chains amiable, every one contributing to bring himſelf into this tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And how vain-glorious ſoever it be, it cannot exact from the humility and ſubmiſſion of its adorers ſuch homages as thoſe that are rendered to it by voluntary Sacrifices; thouſands fall at its right hand, ten thouſands at its left, all at its feet, as being the moſt viſible Ray of the <hi>Divinity</hi> upon Earth.</p>
               <p>It was this <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſeated in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> countenance as on a Throne of <hi>Ivory,</hi> that framed his way, by the eyes, into the <hi>King's</hi> affection. And if the Iron, though heavy and inſenſible, and a Straw, that is light and without reaſon, do by a naturall inclination turn and make towards the Load-ſtone and Amber; if the Load-ſtone that hath touched Iron, doth communicate unto it that ſecret property of ſtanding alwayes towards the <hi>Antartick</hi> Pole; if the Vines love the ſhadow of Olive Trees, and the other Fiſhes delight to follow the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51476:23"/> 
                  <hi>Dolphin,</hi> without any other knowledge than the force of inſtinct: Who can deny that <hi>Man,</hi> whoſe ſenſes are inclined to evill from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, may be carried away by Concupiſcence, being allured and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drawn and raviſhed by the objects? That monſtrous vice, the abortive of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> which diffames the Orientall and the Southern parts, is hardly known in the Occidentall and Septentrionall Regions; at leaſt if it be frequent there, it is very rare here; if there it be a vulgar and popular Malady, here it ſeem's to infect none but great perſons. I am not the only Man that eſteems Courts to be the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles of Iniquity, the Theaters of Licenciouſneſs as well as of Vanity, the Schools of Diſſolution and Riot; for ſince Piety is excluded thence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of an Antient Writer, if the ſhades of Impiety reign there, in the place of that Light, what can one imagine to be practiſed there, but the deeds of Darkneſs? Therefore I ſhall not ſtick to ſay, that <hi>Aſmodeus</hi> (that unclean ſpirit which ſuggeſts to animall Creatures the brutall deſires of the fleſh, whom the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Poëts</hi> made a Deity under the name of the Goddeſs of <hi>Cypru's Son</hi>) caſt, like another <hi>Sinon</hi> into <hi>Troy,</hi> ſuch <hi>Grecian</hi> fires into the ſulphurous hearts of the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> that divers of them beholding with too much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the perfections of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and thinking him of a Sex conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his habit, entertained ſuch baſe deſires as ought not to enter into any thought, much leſs bee repeated. Thereupon ſom of them to accompliſh their execrable pretentions, uſed means to ſeduce the young Gentleman to the licentious frequentation of looſe Women; thereby (one vice calling on another) to draw him into more enormous abominations.</p>
               <p>Here I might raiſe the trophy of our young Gallant's chaſtity with lines that would deſerve to be exempted from Oblivion: But becauſe the multitude of weak ſpirits, as well as that of the ill-adviſed, exceeds the number of the ſtrong and prudent, not to offend the infirmity of thoſe, wee will wean the ability of theſe. For as the light of the Sun is injurious to certain Eyes; So the truth is not always well received by all diſcreet hearers. But to believe that ſuch horrible Imaginations could harbour in the <hi>Kings</hi> Breſt, I ſhould hold it a blaſphemy to think it, yet they are Mortalls environed with frailties, and ſubject to failings: And who knows if any ſecret Malignity made the <hi>King</hi> conjecture, that under <hi>Iphigenes</hi> clothes was ſomething more than <hi>Man?</hi> however his affection never went beyond the limits reſerved to Moeſty. But who can hinder Detraction (which carries the venim of <hi>Aſps</hi> upon the lips)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51476:24"/> from ſpreading its poyſon upon the pureſt innocence? Perſons which are ſeated in the higheſt place upon the World's Theater, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ſubjects of obloquies, as the Butts and Blanks of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King,</hi> beſides the merits of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and the remembrance of his former ſervices, ſaw joyned with a raviſhing preſence ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable vertues and perfections in his Son, that as a juſt, prudent and liberall <hi>Prince,</hi> hee could do no leſs than ſhew the eſteem hee made of ſo many rare qualities, which rendred him the ſpectacle and marvell of his Court. And as this life is a perpetuall Game, full of contrarieties and viciſſitudes, the diſgrace and falling of one being the advantage and raiſing of another; as in Heaven when ſome Stars riſe upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> others at the ſame time ſet; when ſome are ſeen, others are hid, it being impoſſible that all ſhould appear to us at once: So at the Court ſeverall Favorites are incompatible, they ſtrive to thruſt each other out of their <hi>Prince's</hi> affection. This drew much envy and many quarrells upon the brave <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> but in all theſe conteſtations Hee came off with ſuch good ſucceſs and ſigns of courage, that as the files do poliſh and ſmooth the Iron by biting it, and the waters of the <hi>Deluge</hi> did raiſe the <hi>Ark</hi> by falling upon it; ſo theſe malicious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions did increaſe the value and reputation of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe ſolid Judgment was able perfectly to diſtinguiſh the Precious from the Vile, and knew what extreme diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there was betwixt the Merit of that vertuous Gentleman, and the Demerits of ſo many others of his age (who loſt themſelves in game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deboiſtneſs) did an act worthy of ſo great a <hi>Prince</hi> to ſeat his favour in ſo good a place, withdrawing it from thoſe who had not purchaſed his countenance by Deſert but Art, imitating thoſe Women that paint, who make borrowed and ſuppoſed Beauties be beloved in them, rather than Naturall.</p>
               <p>This tranſported with a deſperate fury a yong Noble-man, named <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> Son to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Vilne</hi> in <hi>Lithuania.</hi> Hee having been bred Page to the <hi>King,</hi> had found the means ſo to inſinuate himſelf into His Majeſtie's favour, that hee had obteined a great Eſtate, of his gift, and a conſiderable charge in the Court, whereby hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo haughty and inſolent, that his humor was inſupportable. Seeing then that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> entring into Grace was likely to cauſe his Ruine, and that the <hi>King</hi> turning his Eyes from him, and fixing them on this new Object, hee ſhould bee ſupplanted; there was no ſort of <hi>Bravado's</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51476:24"/> and Treacheries that hee left unattempted to provoke the patience of our innocent <hi>Cavalier:</hi> But his Diſcretion augmenting the Arrogance of the <hi>Lithuanian,</hi> whoſe abuſes drew one day ſome language from <hi>Iphigenes</hi> mouth, which gave him to underſtand that hee feared his Biting no more than his Barking. His frowns and threats, (lightning which preſaged a tempeſt neer at hand) were cauſe that the <hi>King</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing his Authority, cut off this Conteſtation in the root, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to contein himſelf within the bounds of his devoir, or quit the Court. This put him into an exceſſive rage, judging by this Soverign Oracle, which way the <hi>King's</hi> Heart inclin'd. <hi>Envy</hi> which murthereth low ſpirits, cruelly gnawed this <hi>Lithuanian's;</hi> but becauſe this vice is ſo ridiculous, that it dares not ſhew it ſelf, hee bit his bridle in ſilence, feeling his heart pierced with a thouſand pricks, to ſee that his Competitor, high in the <hi>King's</hi> favour, acquired every day new honours, and that, (as when a pretious balſome is ſpilt) the good odour of his reputation dilated it ſelf into all parts. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was never mentioned but with tearms of high commendation, as not ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſtoniſhment. If his Face was the glory and delight of thoſe Eyes that beheld him, his Actions full of vertue and winning gracefulneſs purhcaſed him the quality (ſo rare in this age) not only of <hi>Irreprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> but of the <hi>moſt accompliſht</hi> of Gentlemen. Hereupon <hi>Envy,</hi> who is ſick at other men's well being, made <hi>Auguſtus</hi> feel ſuch torment in his mind, as none of all thoſe invented by the barbarous Tyrants men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Hiſtories could parallel. A juſt Vice in the unjuſt hatred it bears to Vertue, ſince it ſerves to torture him that gives it admittance into his ſoul. But the miſchief is, that as the winds incloſed a long time within the bowells of the Earth, at length burſt out with horrible Eart quakes that dis-joyn the frame of nature: So the furies of <hi>Envy</hi> ſuppreſs'd a good while with ſilence, moſt commonly diſcloſe themſelves all at once by moſt tragicall ſucceſſes.</p>
               <p>In all honorable Exerciſes wherein yong Gentlemen uſe to ſhew their activity and skill, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> always had the better. There were no Rings but for his Courſes, ſo exactly could hee command his Horſe and Lance; At the tiltings his gracefull garb raviſhed all the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; At dancings there were no Eyes but for him. And as the <hi>King's</hi> bountry to him was very great, his Expences, Sumptuouſneſs, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Magnificence increaſed proportionably; No body was ſo handſomly dreſſed, ſo richly attired, ſo well attended, ſo well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo well accompanied as hee, and all this with ſo much judgement
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51476:25"/> that it rendred his pomp doubly admirable. Hee was no Gameſter at all, neither was hee guilty of running into any unneceſſary Exceſſes, by which means hee was the abler to appear with the Nobler train. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> raviſht with the Vertues and prudent Conduct of his Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more reſerved and moderate in his expences, imitating him as much as might be poſſible; and although his credit was great with the <hi>King,</hi> it was nothing in compariſon of his Son's; For without entring into the quality of importunate (being very circumſpect in managing his Maſter's favour) Hee alwayes received of the <hi>King</hi> more than hee demanded, conteining himſelf within the compaſs of what hee might or ought to do, if hee had been a greedy ſeeker of his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: But as the Shadow follows thoſe that fly it, ſo doth Proſperity thoſe that look not after it; In leſs than one year's time the <hi>King</hi> gave him a whole County with ſome Offices of <hi>Caſtellains,</hi> and deſtined him alſo for a <hi>Palatinate,</hi> aſſoon as Age had furniſhed him with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Authority requiſite. If Fathers were ſuſceptible of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie againſt their Children, <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had reaſon enough to conceive ſome againſt his Son, ſeeing the rarity of his beauty and diſcretion had thruſt into his Hands in an inſtant a Fortune, which his long ſervices could not attain; (but it is not with her as with a Goale, where thoſe that run faſteſt come the ſooneſt at it:) Hee was very glad to be ſurmounted in that by <hi>Iphignes,</hi> after the cuſtom of moſt Parents, who deſre nothing more than to ſee their Children higher and more advanced in the World than themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen,</hi> a vertuous and wiſe <hi>Princeſs,</hi> and who ſaw but with the <hi>King</hi> her Husband's Eyes, could not but eſteem him whom ſhee ſaw His Majeſty ſo highly prize, and cheriſh, and who poſſeſſed ſo great a ſhare in his Favour. For it is not ſeldom ſeen in Courts that Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites have more power in effect, though not ſo much ſtate in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than the <hi>Queens,</hi> and that to accompliſh their deſires in ſome caſes, theſe are glad to have recourſe to their mediation. In ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a man had need have a good brain not to be made drunk with the fuming vapors of Favour and a ſtrong ſight, not to be dazled with the ſplendor of ſo great a Light: for what Soul is there ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that would not feele it ſelf puff't up, at leaſt ſomewhat more than glad, at ſuch a height of Fortune, as rendreth in ſome ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, a perſon who acknowledgeth no Superior but God? It was in this particular that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> made chiefly appear the Excellency of his Wiſdom, demeaning himſelf with ſuch moderation and humility
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51476:25"/> towards the <hi>Queen,</hi> that hee was in a no leſs degree of favour with her than with the <hi>King,</hi> ſo far forth as to receive many conſiderable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from her hand, not without ſome murmuring of the Ladies about her perſon, who wondered to ſee her beſtow ſuch liberalities upon a Man, contrary to her cuſtom, and in their opinion, ſomewhat beyond Decency. But ſhee conforming her ſelf to her Husband's hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, did onely ſhew by this imitation how much ſhee honored the <hi>King,</hi> ſeeing it was enough that Hee eſteemed any one, to make her ſhew him the like reſpect and Countenance. Indeed it is probable, if ſhee had known all the myſtery, or if the unbridled luſts of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalls</hi> could fall into the imagination of the <hi>Septentrionalls,</hi> that Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie might have poſſeſt her with ſome ill thoughts of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> But the incomparable Chaſtity and Modeſty that apeared in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, begat him ſo admirable an Opinion, that all the Men in the Court (and indeed wihout danger) would freely have truſted all their Wives to his keeping, as if hee had been the <hi>Prince</hi> of the grand <hi>Signor's</hi> Eunuches. There was never ſeen a Youth ſo diſcreet, a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo chaſt, a Favorite ſo courteous, a Greatneſs ſo affable, a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo reſerved, an Elevation ſo moderate, a great Courage ſo humble, a Generoſity ſo judicious; Hee was the Spectacle of aſtoniſhment, the Miracle of Grace, the Ornament of Nature, the Glory of his Country, the Joy of thoſe that had dependance on him, the Honor of his Linage, and we may add the Flower of <hi>Polonia,</hi> the Eye of the Court, the Orient of Vertues, and the Occident of Vice.</p>
               <p>At all the Juſts and Turnaments made for publick rejoycings, where <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was of the anſwering Party, (and alwayes Conqueror) <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> who ſtudied nothing more than to meet with ſome occaſion to do him an affront or miſchief, made this Opportunity the Baud of his baſe Deſign, like thoſe Traytors who in a <hi>Salve</hi> of Infantry at a Trayning (where they ſhould uſe none but Powder) do charge their Muskets with Bullets, to ſhoot at ſome particular Enemies. For wheres all Gentlemen did run with but ſlight Arms, becauſe their Lances were only pegg'd purpoſely that they might break in pieces at the leaſt touch, that exerciſe, having no other end than to delight the Spectators; <hi>Auguſtus</hi> being to run againſt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> furniſhed himſelf with a Lance plated with Iron and ground very ſharp, intending to pierce him through, or at leaſt to make him ſo rudely meaſure the ground with his Body that hee ſhould ſerve for a laughing-ſtock to all that ſaw him. But the Powers who love Juſtice, hate Iniquity,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51476:26"/> and above all do abhor Traytors, turned this malicious deſire upon <hi>Auguſtus</hi> own head; For, miſſing his Reſt his Lance ſlided along the ſmooth guilded Arms of his Adverſary, who not failing of his aym, broke his all to ſhivers with a very becoming grace; but one of the ſplinters falling with the point downwards pierced <hi>Auguſtus</hi> thigh, which put him to an intolerable pain. The furious <hi>Lithuanian</hi> ſeeing his blood, was inraged with Choler that hee was hurt, and no leſs mad for Spight that hee had miſt his thruſt; Inſomuch that without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that his wound proceeded from Accident and not from <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> will, as if hee had been highly offended in his honour, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with full career, his Sword drawn, to revenge that affront upon <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> who proteſting innocence, and declaring that hee was ſorry for that chance, hee cryed out to him to draw or hee would kill him, vomiting againſt him a thouſand injurious reproaches not becoming the mouth of a <hi>Cavalier. Iphigenes</hi> who was not uſed to ſuch careſſes, put himſelf in a poſture to receive him and make him feel the puniſhment of his Arrogance. <hi>Augustus</hi> came full ſpeed with his Sword's point towards <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to run him through, or bear him to the ground; But <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who had more ſleight than ſtrength, putting by that thruſt, charged him ſo home, that of a furious Aſſailant he had enough to do to prove himſelf a good Defendant. The <hi>King,</hi> who with the <hi>Queen</hi> was preſent at this ſhew, ſeeing this Quarrell begun by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who was the Aggreſſor, commanded them to give over fighting. But the inraged <hi>Lithuanian</hi> refuſed, ſaying, the <hi>King</hi> was Maſter of his Eſtate and Life, not of his Honour, which hee fancied was then highly intereſſed. This proud reply ſo incenſed the <hi>King,</hi> that hee commanded his Guards to cut him in peices preſently; mean time the Combat continued, and notwithſtanding diverſe <hi>Cavalier's</hi> intervening to hinder them, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> being mounted upon a Horſe as full of fire as his Maſter of fury, made himſelf paſſage in deſight of all thoſe that indeavoured to ſeparate them: And being even ready to fall, like a haſty ſtorm, upon his Adverſary with a quick back-blow the dexterous <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſlit the noſtrills of his Courſer, who foaming and breathing fire out of his mouth, reared up on end and flung ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately with pain, that caſting his Rider with his heels upwards, added to the hurt upon his Thigh, the breaking in pieces of a Leg. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> nimbly leaping from his Ginet to give <hi>Augustus</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to fight on foot alſo (though hee could have made his Horſe paſſing and repaſſing trample out his guts) found him in no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51476:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> to contend; So, without taking any other advantage than that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him deliver his Sword, hee gave him his life before all that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, notwithſtanding the <hi>King</hi> gave order he ſhould bee kill'd for having diſobeyed his Command. This done, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> proſtrated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> ceaſing not to ſupplicate untill he had changed his Indignation into Clemencio, and obteined Life for him who would have procured his Death. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was carried to his own houſe, loaded with as much infamy and ſhame, as <hi>Iphigenes</hi> reurned covered with the Laurells of triumph and glory: By chance one of his friends taking up <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Lance, found it made purpoſely to doe miſchief, being very ſtrongly plated with Iron and ſharp-pointed, ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his unworthy intentions; This being told the <hi>King,</hi> hee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him the Court for ever, notwithſtanding <hi>Iphigenes</hi> employed all the credit hee had to procure his pardon.</p>
               <p>The Sun is never without Shadows, nor Vertue free from Envy: yet among ſo many thorns ſome flowers may bee gathered. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had ſo much quaintneſs and ſuch ſources of polite ſubtilities in his brain, was ſo dexterous and happy in captivating hearts, that he was called the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that Art. It is true that ſhadows do ſtill accompany the Sun, but they are very ſhort, when hee is Elevated to his <hi>Apogee,</hi> or the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall point of the <hi>Horizon.</hi> So <hi>Iphigenes</hi> being arrived at the higheſt degree of favour, and (which is very rare) as pretious in the <hi>King,</hi> his Maſter'<hi>s</hi> ſight, as in the <hi>Queen,</hi> his Miſtreſſe'<hi>s,</hi> in this <hi>Zenith</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hee contemned the vaine vapors of Envy, ſeeing, as it were from the top of a lofty mountain, the rowling Thunder grumble, and the ſtormy clowds burſt under his feet. There are few that haunt Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites but either very powerfull or inconſiderable perſons. For if the <hi>Royalty</hi> bee for them, is it not a Giant-like preſumption to offer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that Greatneſs? If the Gods of the Earth bee for them, who can ſurmount, nay, who dares contradict them? Yet as wee ſee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the glory of the World'<hi>s</hi> Eye bee never ſo bright, the leaſt Atomes and exhalations (like moats) do riſe to oppoſe and blemiſh it, but are as ſoon depreſt as raiſed, and no ſooner gathered together than diſſolved: So do preſumptuous ſpirits revolt and combine ſometimes againſt the Eldeſt <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Fortune;</hi> but their fruitleſs indeavours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately do make appear the weakneſs, as well as the baſeneſs of their hearts, ſwollen and pufft up with Vanity, rather than filled with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Such was <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſuch approved himſelf another Noble-man, named <hi>Polignotes,</hi> of whoſe vapouring and jealous <hi>Bravadoes</hi> I ſhall at
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51476:27"/> this preſent omit to make any further mention, eſteeming it more to purpoſe, by mingling ſweet with ſower, to temper the animoſities of theſe envious Antagoniſts, with the delicious amity of the innumerable friends, which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had purchaſed by his moſt perfect Courteſie. This admirable knot of Friendſhip (which is the ſweeteſt bond of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society) in its perfection is an Enemy to Multiplicity: A man may be Friendly to all, but ſhould be Familiar with few, and in this Vertuous Familiarity conſiſts that Communication, which giveth life and being to true Friendſhip. To eſtabliſh an eminent Fortune and high favour, a man hath need, as of divers Supporters, of many Friends; But in regard <hi>Favour</hi> (no more than <hi>Love</hi>) can admit of no Corrivalls, it was <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> induſtry ſto to manage the good wills of thoſe, that expreſſed any affection towards him, that making them participant of his Riches, hee reſerved the <hi>King</hi>'s favour intire to himſelf. Thus do thoſe that make preſents of Fruit, keeping the Tree and the Ground ſtill in their own poſſeſſion: Thus may one diſtribute Water, and allow their Neighbours part, and yet retain the Spring in its wonted place.</p>
               <p>Among others, of lower degree (I do not ſay for matter of quality, but affection) there were two particularly in favour with <hi>Iphigenes:</hi> One was a young Prince of <hi>Polonia,</hi> named <hi>Caſſin,</hi> the other a Noble man of a very antient family known by the name of <hi>Pomeran;</hi> this was the Minion of his heart, and (as it were) the <hi>Favorite</hi> of the <hi>Favorite,</hi> for Hee loved with much tenderneſs the perſon of <hi>Iphigenes:</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (who cheriſhed rather his greatneſs and quality, ardently embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing whatſoever had reference to his Intereſt and Glory) was as the <hi>favorite</hi> of the <hi>Favor;</hi> like <hi>Hephestion</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> the two friends of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> whereof one loved him as <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other as <hi>King. Caſſin</hi> and <hi>Pomeran</hi> were the two Arms and Eyes of our young Count, as thoſe that applyed themſelves more particularly to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him. <hi>Pomeran,</hi> being more diſintereſſed, conſidered nothing but the perſon of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> for which Hee did feel paſſions, which would have been much more Violent, if hee had been as Skilfull to penetrate the ſecret of darkneſs, as Ignorance made him incurious. The Prince (who graſped at great Charges, and whoſe ambitious humour aymed at nothing but thoſe Grandeurs, whereunto by his extraction hee juſtly might pretend, but could not yet arrive by reaſon of his too unripe age) accoſted <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ladder, that hee might thereby clime to the top of his pretenſions. His Mother (who ſhall likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51476:27"/> upon this ſtage, under the name of <hi>Reſpicia</hi>) brought him into the World before Shee could fully reckon the third luſter of her age, her Husband (who had bee one of the higheſt rank in the Kingdome) having left her a widdow in her five and twentieth year; And although Shee was owner of Beauty enough to make her bee beloved, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed an Eſtate that might invite the greateſt in that Countrey to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, yet the affection Shee did bear to the memory of her deceaſed Husband, and the conſideration Shee had of her two Children, made her remain almoſt ten years in a conſtant Widdowhood, breeding with all the ſplendour and care imaginable, thoſe two pretious pledges of her former flames. However being one of the moſt conſderable Ladies in the Court, and living in the height of delights (though then arrived at her five and thirtieth year) Shee found at length the death of her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the inevitable charms of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Beauty. This <hi>COKELVCHE</hi> or <hi>Court-Vertigo</hi> had ſo turned her brain, that Shee forgot both the Idea of her Husband, the Affection to her Children, and the Care of her ſelf, expoſing her ſelf to the hazard of being the table-talk through the whole World, to the diſadvantage of that Honour, of whoſe preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Shee had always thitherto made ſo exact a profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Creatures that are ſignalized for the greateſt Wiles, when they are taken, do diſplay all their Shifts; ſo did this ſubtill-witted Lady, when Shee perceived her ſelf tyed by the Heart with ſuch delicious bands, that ſhee preferred this Servitude before her former Liberty. For, the better to diſſemble her wound, the more ſhee felt the ſmart, of all the Ladies in the Court ſhee was obſerved to ſpeak the ſeldomeſt and the leaſt advantagiouſly of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſuppreſſing all her paſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her breſt without ſuffering it to evaporate at the paſſage of her mouth but by very ſlight ſparkles. But if ſhee ſaid little ſhee thought the more, and fancied no mean projects to accompliſh the deſign ſhee had to make her ſelf lawfully his Wife. Widdows, who have learned in their Matrimoniall obſervances the ſecrets of pleaſing Men, and how to intrap them, ſend glances from their Eyes ſo much the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, the leſs they are innocent; And as the moſt ſparkling fire and hotteſt embers, are thoſe which are cover'd with aſhes; as the moſt ſhining flaſhes of Lightning are thoſe which proceed from the blackeſt Clouds: So the kidneſſes that come from under thoſe great Veils, are generally the moſt attractive; thoſe are the Fires that blaze in the midſt of Water, when from Eyes deſtined to Tears are caſt ſuch ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looks. Yet all theſe artificiall affectations were Vainly employed by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51476:28"/> this <hi>Princeſs</hi> to conquer or inveagle <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> whoſe Heart was no leſs ſuſceptible of theſe flames, than his Body was capable of thoſe legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Embraces to which ſhee did aſpire. However <hi>Iphigenes</hi> did very much eſteem her perſon, but it was in that manner as hee could and ought, not as ſhee deſired. This cautelous Student in <hi>Love</hi>'s Politicks had learned particularly by <hi>Mieſlas</hi> (the depth of whoſe thoughts ſhee had ſounded by her ſugred ſpeeches) that the marriage of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> was not conſummated: Whereupon ſhee contrived a Plot, that will make appear the ſubtilty of a Wit refined by that Paſſion, which puts Invention into the ſimpleſt and moſt blockiſh brains.</p>
               <p>Shee, who had a conceit that Marriage conſiſted only in the uſe of the Bodies, never conſidering that the Union of the Hearts and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the Wills, are the materialls whereof if formed the Eſſence of Matrimony, flattered her ſelf that ſhee ſhould eaſily diſannull or untie that knot betwixt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> and put her ſelf in <hi>Modeſtina</hi>'s place; But fearing leſt a repulſe ſhould make her the fable of the Court, and expoſe her to the people's ſcorn, ſhee thought beſt to bring her Daughter into play, and propoſe her to <hi>Mieſlas</hi> for <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with ſuch advantages as were neither in the Fortune nor perſon of <hi>Modeſtina.</hi> This Daughter of her's, named <hi>Simphoroza,</hi> was yet very young, but did promiſe in the <hi>Aurora</hi> of her age great perfections of Beauty at her <hi>Noon.</hi> The <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia</hi> who devoured in his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thoughts all thoſe high proffers of the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> (believing that <hi>Roſuald</hi>'s Eſtate would however be intirely his own, by making <hi>Liante</hi> imbrace an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> life, and giving ſome ſlight Dowry to <hi>Modeſtina;</hi>) was eaſily induced to hearken to her propoſitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering (beſides the great fortune ſhee promiſed to make her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the ſplendor of ſo Noble an Allaince; But this cunning Mother'<hi>s</hi> deſigne was only to ſubſtitute her ſelf in her Daughter'<hi>s</hi> place (who was yet nothing neer Marriageable) and to ſupply with the luſter of her Gold and immenſe Eſtate, what ſhee wanted in Beauty, or was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant in Years; Thus the <hi>Father</hi> was gained, which ſeemed no ſmall advancement to our Pretendant'<hi>s</hi> intentions, every one being apt to believe eaſily what they do deſire. But the difficulty ws in obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Son</hi>'s conſent, (who being advertiſed of this Deſign by <hi>Mie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlas,</hi> and knowing in his Soule that hee was no leſs unfit to bee <hi>Simpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reza</hi>'s Husband than <hi>Modeſtina</hi>'s, not to multiply his deceipts,) reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the propoſitions, feining ſcruples of Conſcience, much paſſion for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51476:28"/> his wife, and giving <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to underſtand that hee had proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the terms of Marriage with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> then hee imagined. The rigorous <hi>Podolian</hi> (who had in a manner ingaged his word to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> thinking to finde more obedience in his Son's ſpirit) was ready to burſt into a furious fit of Choller at this reſiſtance, but conſidering that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> by his favour had all the power with the <hi>King,</hi> hee reteined the impetuoſity of his paſſion, giving teſtimony enough however of his diſpleaſure by the alterations of his Countenance. Notwithſtanding this refuſall <hi>Respicia</hi> gave not over her purſuite, feining, like a good Mother, to bee paſſionate for the advancement of her Children, for whom ſhee could procure nothing more advantageus than the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Favour</hi> (mean time it was her own intereſt made her act with ſo much ſolicitude:) According to the nature of her Sexe, which never ceaſeth asking untill they atchieve their end, ſhee prayed, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preſſed in time, out of time, leaving no means unattempted; and it was partly her perſwaſion that made the <hi>Prince Caſſin,</hi> her Son, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch devoirs to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> which made him worthy of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherein hee ſucceeded as is already mentioned. Thus did this crafty Spider ſpread her Web to inſnare the beautifull Adoleſcent, and make her ſelf wife to him, of whom ſhee might have been the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Shee had ſuch a hand over <hi>Caſſin,</hi> that this young <hi>Prince</hi> at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance uſed all the arguments his Invention could ſuggeſt, to induce <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to marry his Siſter, to whom, for quality, <hi>Modeſtina</hi> was not comparable. But <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had the skill to divert his diſcourſe with ſuch modeſty and dexterity, that without giving him any occasion of diſtaſt, hee amuſed his expectation, and by little and little made him relinquiſh that thought, which hee eſteemed unjuſt. It is an opinion that Batteries made Croſſe-wiſe are the moſt deſtructive; <hi>Respicia</hi> raiſed her's in this manner, and as if ſhee had been deſirous to ſink all her houſe (which was one of the moſt opulent of <hi>Polonia</hi>) into the family of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> ſhee offered him to give her Dauther to his Son, and her Son to his Daugher <hi>Clemencia,</hi> and ſo make but one of both their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. which the <hi>Palatine,</hi> dazled at the ſplendour of ſo much honour, imbraced with both hands, not perceiving the hook that was hidden under this bait. Mean time <hi>Reſpicia</hi> covered ſo dexterouſly her <hi>Love</hi> under the mask of <hi>Ambition,</hi> that whileſt ſhee was called a carefull and loving Mother, ſhee aymed at another Mark. Her importunities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the oppreſſing inſtances of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> did ſhrewdly tempt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51476:29"/> the patience of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who againſt all theſe aſſaults had no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence than the rampier of the Fidelity which hee owed, &amp; which hee had ſworn to his wife <hi>Modeſtina</hi> to whom, being preſſed with theſe ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Hee wrote ſuch paſſionate letters, that the moſt affectionate of Lovers could not expreſs his imaginations in a ſtyle more Patheticall: Which kindled ſuch a fire in the bowels of this Maiden Spouſe, that the too much ſenſe of Love deprived her of all ſenſe. You may add to that Love, the Fear which is inſepirable from thoſe who fervently do affect, and the Apprehenſion of loſing, by Change, that which is more pretious than Life. For ſhee knew by the mouth of Fame, which hath a thouſand tongues and by letters from <hi>Iphigenes</hi> own hand, that hee was the common object of the Eyes and Hearts of all the Court Ladies, which bred a torment in her Miad, inconceivable by any Soul, that hath not experimented the juſt and incomparable affections that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd her heart. A thouſand times ſhee was in the mind to go to Court to her Husband, and ſay to all her Rivalls, <hi>What do you? hee is intirely mine, as I am ſolely his; Your pretenſions are too unjuſt to find any acceſs into his breſt, who is nothing but Fidelity, who feeds amongst the Lillies of Purity, and the Roſes of Honour: Your attractions are too ſlight to move ſo conſtant a Spirit; Your Paſſions, bee they fein'd or reall, are but weak Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours before the Sun of his Reaſon. Why then with too licentious a deſire do you indeavour to purloin a treaſure, that belongs peculiarly to mee? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your fond affections, baniſh thoſe no leſs Vain than unanſwerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions from your thoughts, for</hi> Iphigenes <hi>hath ingaged his faith to mee by the indiſſolvable tyes of a moſt ſacred</hi> Hymen.</p>
               <p>Thus did this loving Spouſe entertain her troubled mind, but Shame oppoſing her Deſign (if there can bee any ſhame in the legitimate deſires of a chaſt wife) or rather the impoſſibiity of diſengaging her ſelf from under <hi>Aretuza</hi>'s wing, and the ſtrict guard of the too ſevere <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua,</hi> made her ſeek in Patience the common Remedy of all her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. How often did ſhee pleaſe her fancy with the imagination of tranſveſting her ſelf, and by the help of a Man'<hi>s</hi> diſguiſe deceiving the eyes of thoſe that watched her deportments, to convey her ſelf into the Court to her beloved <hi>Iphigenes?</hi> But that Honour, whereof ſhee was ſo Jealous, did choak this Reſolution at its birth, conſidering that ſuch an Equipage would not only make her the diſcourſe of inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cenſurers, but in ſtead of rendring her Husband a teſtimony of her Love, might perhaps attract upon her Innocence his Diſlike. At length, not to do any thing unbeſeeming her quality, ſhee reſolved to hearken
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51476:29"/> to <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and let <hi>Diſcretion</hi> prevail over all thoſe Surges of <hi>Paſſion:</hi> Shee comforted her ſelf with her letters from <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> the words in every line whereof were as many proteſtations of Conſtancy, and new oaths of Fidelity. The ſeverall vertues ſhee had remarked in her dear Husband were as many Proofs, and thoſe Proofs as many Aſſurances of his invariable Purity, whereupon ſhee repoſed all her thoughts; And theſe thoughts, which often made her ſequeſter her ſelf into ſad unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented places, were her moſt delicious recreations. The ſhade of woods, the coolneſs of Gardens, and the agreeable murmuring of Fountains fomented in her breſt that humour which nouriſhed it ſelf with the dear remembrance of her adored Husband's perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And if ſuch were the reſentments of this Turtle, being ſeparated from the preſence of her mate; Think not that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> felt any leſs diſcomfort amongſt all his greatneſſes, which hee would willingly have ſhared to his dear Friend and Wife, or, to have rendred the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perfect, have injoyed in their preſence. His affection to <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> and the Love hee bare <hi>Liante,</hi> never ſuffered him to take any reſt, notwithſtanding the multitude of Felicities, wherewith the <hi>King</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour had (in a manner) overwhelmed him. Thus in this world wee can have nothing perfect: Thoſe whom wee do many times imagine (ſeeing them born up by the wings of the Wind of a <hi>Prince</hi>'s favour) to Swim in an Ocean of Delights, do find amongſt the agreeable flowers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſome ſecret prickle of Sorrow, which marreth the harmony of their Proſperity. Of ſo many Objects whereunto the Court did invite <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> to affix his affections, hee ſaw as few that hee deemed worthy of the application of his thoughts, as Hee who looked for a Man with a candle, at mid-day, amongſt a great Aſſembly in a publick place. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the want of Freedome and Vertue (which is great amongſt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers) made him meet with a ſcarcity of friends in that multitude which environed him; or whether (which is very probable) the firſt impreſſions of affection had ſo ſeaſoned the new Veſſell of his Heart, that here was no poſſibility of making it take any other tincture, or taſt, than that which hee had reliſhed in the converſation of <hi>Modeſtina</hi> and <hi>Liante,</hi> the ſweet Objects of his education and moſt tender years: His Diſpoſition being of an excellent temperature, and his Heart no coveter of Wealth, <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> (which are the two Bonds, the two Charms, and, as I may ſay, the two poiſoned Tets of the <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour</hi>) had very little intereſt in his Soul; And <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> (which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51476:30"/> according to the ſaying of an antient Orator, hath no place of abode in the Kingdom of Vertue) could find no acceſs in his Body, too Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt not to bee Continent: No wonder then if the fetters of the Court, though made of Gold and pretious Stones, were irkſome unto him; and the ſincere, chaſte and true affection which hee bore thoſe two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Objects of his Love, made him in the midſt of ſo many pleaſures languiſh with the deſire of their preſence.</p>
               <p>The paſſionate reſentments of his Soul for this deteſted Separation, He feelingly expreſt in ſeverall letters to <hi>Modeſtina</hi> and <hi>Liante,</hi> which they interchangeably communicated to each other according to the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Overſeers, &amp; in order to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> particular injunction, who at his departure from them did earneſtly intreat <hi>Liante</hi> to take, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him, the affectionate letters hee ſhould write to his Siſter, proteſting that the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> hee did bear him, was no leſs tender nor leſs ardent, than his <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (as may eaſily be believed by one that knows the reaſon, whereof <hi>Liante</hi> as yet was ignorant.) One day (<hi>Modeſtina</hi> and her Brother having been allarmed, by letters from the faithfull <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Respicia</hi>'s deſign of breaking their Marriage, and giving him her Daughter to wife; whereunto hee had been Sollicited by <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> whom ſhee had gained; But that hee had rejected their propoſitions, chooſing rather to loſe his life than his Loyalty) Hee received letters from them full of complaints and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſentments of Jealouſie; <hi>Modeſtina</hi> feining to fear, or fearing in effect that the rare Beauties and great Honors, whereof the Court is the Element, would in time raviſh from her the Mind as well as the Body of her <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> And <hi>Liante</hi> writing that the acquaintance of great Ones would perchance make him not value the friendſhip of meaner Perſons, in which rank hee placed himſelf. Whereunto a Reply was ſpeedily diſpatcht, which conteining large expreſſions of a holy and reall affection, comforted a little thoſe two tender hearts which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed one for her Husband, the other for his ſincere Friend: But why do I ſay comforted? I ſhould rather ſay, that it cauſed the ſame effect in the ſorrow of their Privation, as water in a Smith'<hi>s</hi> forge being caſt upon burning coals, whoſe heat it doth increaſe; Or as thoſe hot drops of raine extorted by the <hi>Sun</hi> during the ardors of Summer, which rather Scald than Wet. Indeed if wee meaſured their diſcontents for his abſence, with the ſatisfaction they would have received by the preſence and poſſeſſion of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> wee might judge of its extremity. However not to give <hi>Iphigenes</hi> any occaſion to bee afflicted at their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51476:30"/> ſuſpitions, they made him underſtand by Letters how great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they had in his promiſe and conſtancy, acknowedging that thoſe honours which are accuſtomed to change the diſpoſitions of weak and vulgar Souls, are below the thoughts of them that place their honour in their Faith, and who are not Reeds of the Deſart in unconſtancy, but Pillars of the Temple of Stability.</p>
               <p>By this reciprocall intelligence of Letters theſe three loving Hearts mainteined the harmony of their concord, that ſerved for Oyl to nouriſh the Lamp of their mutuall affection. Mean time <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> bleſſed with the dew of Heaven and Earth, was the true Child of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and the Nurſling of <hi>Fortune, Fortune</hi> in him ſeeming to have loſt thoſe two qualities of <hi>Blinde,</hi> and being an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſince ſhee knew ſo worthily and ſo abundantly to acknowledge his Merit. The greateſt ſecret to gain <hi>Fortune</hi> is to be Juſt, to abſtein from Evill and do Good, for it is with Juſtice as with Wiſdom, all ſorts of felicity do attend her. The ſame ſucceſs doth not accompany thoſe, who by oblique and undirect wayes do ſeek to accompliſh their pretenſions, in imitation of Ships, who having but a bare quarter wind, do laveer and turn ſeverall wayes before they can arrive at their intended Port. The <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> being ſtung with that Waſp that rob's Minds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſollicited <hi>Mieſlas</hi> without intermiſſion, to preſs <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to the rupture of his <hi>non</hi> conſummated Marriage, and become Spouſe to her Daughter, <hi>Simphoroza;</hi> Which propoſition jumped with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's diſpoſition, being equally greedy after her Wealth and Honour, eſpecially the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> likewiſe promiſing to marry <hi>Clemencia.</hi> As for this laſt Marriage, <hi>Iphigenes's</hi> conſent was eaſily obteined thereunto, nay more, hee deſired it might be accompliſhed, to draw that thorn out of his foot, I mean, that point of Jealouſie, which ſticking at his Heart did cauſe him to fear, leſt <hi>Liante</hi> ſhould bee ſo deeply ingaged in <hi>Clemencia's</hi> Love, that Hee ſhould not be able to conquer his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when the time for his Revelation and Metamorphoſis ſhould be expired: But for the other hee labored all hee could to hinder it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging his Faith given, the Honour of his Word, his Affection to <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> and the Obligations hee had to the fervency of her Love, whom hee would have them eſteem as his Wife. All this <hi>Mieſlas</hi> (after the manner of great Perſons, who uſe to make and unmake Marriages according to their Intereſts) called Superſtitious and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Scruples, telling his Son, by way of reproach, that hee was too Religious for a Courtier, and too ſtrict an obſerver of his word for a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51476:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> Favortie. <hi>At leaſt,</hi> ſayd hee, <hi>Do not oppoſe the advancement of your Siſter's Fortune by your too fond inclinations for</hi> Modeſtina; whereupon <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſodainly replying, promiſed, <hi>That hee would contribute the utmoſt of his endeavours to further the Match between the Prince</hi> Caſſin <hi>and his Siſter</hi> Clementia; and to that effect hee became a frequent Viſiter of <hi>Respicia,</hi> who did expreſs ſuch extraordinary kindneſs in her receptions, that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> might eaſily have perceived the full ſcope of her thoughts, and whereunto did tend thoſe Nets which ſhee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him. For producing her Daughter before him, rather loaden than deck't with Jewells, beſides her Youth, being yet Infantine in a manner (an Age that hath neither Beauty nor Uglineſs) her deſign was to induce him to make a Change, and catch him in her own Trap by attracting his looks upon her ſelf. But <hi>Iphigenes</hi> being what hee was, ran no danger of being intangled in ſuch Snares, this Bait and Line were not proper for that <hi>Fiſh.</hi>

                  <hi>Love,</hi> how blind ſoever hee is eſteemed, hath <hi>Linxe's</hi> Eyes, which penetrate to the very thoughts. <hi>Staniſlas Palatine</hi> of <hi>Vratiſlaü,</hi> being a Widower in the ſtrength of his Age, and having no other iſſue than an onely Daughter, had caſt his Eyes upon the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> as the Party of all the Court moſt ſuitable to his quality. Shee through a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity common to all Women, who take a pride in ſeeing themſelves Obſerved, Courted, and Adored, admitted of his Viſits, and by a tacite conſentment approved of his Suite in not rejecting it. For, yong Widdows, that ſuffer Men to accoſt them, that give ear to their offers of Service, and their proteſtations of Fidelity, do ſeem (as Miſtreſſes of their Motions) to give theſe Suiters ſome hold upon their liberty, or at leaſt to foment a hope in them that their Vows ſhall not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing. This Noble-man holding <hi>Reſpicia</hi> for his Miſtreſs, was not well ſatisfied to ſee her viſited by our Favorite, whoſe glory dazled all the World, and effaced the luſter of the moſt Eminent perſons. But his diſpleaſure was redoubled, when hee perceived by <hi>Reſpicia's</hi> actions and countenance, that ſhee participated of the <hi>Court-vertigo</hi> for this fair <hi>Podolian.</hi> At laſt hee grew beyond all temper, having intelligence of the Marriage which was projected betwixt the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> and <hi>Clementia;</hi> (for hee Marrying the Mother intended to match his Daughter to her Son, and by their double Alliance to draw the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe's</hi> vaſt eſtate into his own hands.) But when hee heard of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that were offered to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> if hee would take to Wife the <hi>Princeſſe's</hi> Daughter <hi>Simphoroza,</hi> this raiſed ſo furious a diſorder in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51476:31"/> his Mind, that hee believed the <hi>Favour</hi> would ruine all his pretentions, if hee did not ſpeedily rid his Hands of the <hi>Favorite.</hi> Already <hi>Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> had no more any Eyes to ſee him, no Mouth to ſpeak to him, no reception for his Viſits; hee perceived nothing in her Actions but a cold Reſervedneſs, in her Countenance Diſdain, at his arrivall Sadneſs, at his departure Joy; apparent ſigns of his being in diſgrace, if hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not, all his hoes are vaniſhed. <hi>Ambition</hi> kindled his <hi>Love, Love</hi> ſuſcitated <hi>Jealouſie, Jealouſie</hi> hatched <hi>Deſpair,</hi> and <hi>Despair</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated him into ſuch a rage as made him eſpouſe the wickedeſt of reſolutions, to Sacrifice to his <hi>Revenge</hi> the Innocent blood of him who thought nothing leſs than to ſupplant him in the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia's</hi> Favour.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51476:32"/> retired ſome little diſtance, <hi>Staniſlas</hi> ſaid to him in a fierce arrogant manner, <hi>That hee porceived hee had a deſign to eſtabliſh a fortune to his prejudice, which was a thing repugnant to the Laws of Chivalry and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that hee might find wayes enough to advance himſelf about the</hi> King, <hi>without going to trouble or thwart his pretenſions to the</hi> Princeſs Reſpicia, <hi>to whom Hee was Servant and ambitioned to be Husband, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending likewiſe, by Marrying her, to make</hi> Caſſin <hi>his Son in Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee wiſhed him to deſiſt from pretending to that Alliance, which (hee heard) was projected betwixt him and</hi> Simphoroza, <hi>and that betwixt</hi> Clemencia <hi>and the</hi> Prince Caſſin: <hi>Otheriwſe Hee being obliged to reſent ſo injurious an Affront, was reſolved to revenge it with his Sword. Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> anſwered very mildly (but with a reſolution full of generoſity) <hi>That Hee ſhould be very ſorry to make any advantage of another Man's detriment; That thitherto Hee had ſo managed his Fortune, that no body could frame any complaint againſt him for that reſpect; That Hee knew too well the honour which was due to His quality, and what Hee owed to his own Modesty to begin with Him to diſoblige, by any prejudice, perſons of ſuch Eminence. That for his alliance with</hi> Simphoroza, <hi>it was not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but impoſſible, and whereof hee never had nor ſhould imbrace any thought (although it might be done without tentering his Conſcience) his affections beeing already ſo ingaged to</hi> Modeſtina, <hi>that, if ſhee were not his Wife, hee never would have any other, And therefore hee might reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for that point: As for the Marriage of the</hi> Prince Caſſin <hi>with his Siſter</hi> Clementia, <hi>it proceeded rather from</hi> Reſpicia's <hi>own ſeeking, than any motion of his, and for that hee did appeal to the Teſtimony of the</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>her ſelf, to whoſe Alliance hee did neither hinder him to pretend, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would hee barr</hi> Caſſin <hi>of the free liberty to chooſe his Daughter, or</hi> Clemencia. Who could have ansered with greater moderation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and ſincerity? Yet the Savage <hi>Sarmation</hi> drawing vanity from the ſweetneſs of this reply, like Spiders which make venim of Roſes, rudely thus retorted, <hi>that is was not enough that hee pretended nothing to</hi> Simphoroza; <hi>but that</hi> Clemencia <hi>muſt not be Married to</hi> Caſſin: Adding (with a proud Bravado) <hi>That there was not that Man living, that ſhould dare to look upon her Mother, but ſhould receive Death from his Hand.</hi> At which words <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with an accent no leſs civill then reſolute ſaid; <hi>My Lord</hi> Palatine, <hi>I have already told you that the Mother is left to Your ſelf; That I pretend nothing to the Daughter, and as for my Siſter ſhee hath never yet ſeen</hi> Caſſin, <hi>neither hath ſhee any will but that of her Parents, who are diſcreet enough; the management of ſuch matters belong's
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51476:33"/> particularly to them, and they know beſt what they have to do; Marriages are free, and Violence ought to have no place in ſuch Sacred ties. And I told you</hi> (replyed Staniſlas) <hi>that that doth prejudice mee, that I am the first pretendant to that Alliance, and no Man ſhall come to tread in my ſteps, but I will make him repent it, let him be ne'r ſo much in Favour, and his quality ne'r ſo eminent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Iphigenes</hi> preſently made this anſwer, <hi>It ſeeme's</hi> Staniſlas, <hi>by the word</hi> Favour, <hi>that you addreſs your ſpeech to mee, as if I were the Subject of your diſcontent: I wear by my ſide where withall to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to perſons of Honour, and you muſt know that I am no Man to ſuffer ſuch out-braving Language. What I have ſaid already ought to ſatisfie you, if you are reaſonable; but if you are beyond that, I know the way to make you return to Reaſon.</hi> The Proud <hi>Palatine</hi> who aymed at nothing but to pick a quarrell, perſwading himſelf by the weakly proportion of body, and the unſouldier-like countenance of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that a ſtout Heart could not bee harboured under ſo fair a Face; beſides ſeeing himſelf at that time not onely better Horſed, but advantaged with a great Sable or Cimeterr which hung by his ſide, replied; <hi>There's too much ſaid, Men of my Birth and Quality are not accustomed to bear ſuch words, I must take thy Life, and ſo deliver</hi> Polonia <hi>from the Tyranny which thou doſt exerciſe over their Soveraign.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Iphigenes</hi> immediately thus: <hi>I owe nothing to thy Birth, nor to thy Quality, they are both equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, nay ſurpaſſed by mine, and ſince my Mouth could not ſatisfie thee with Reaſon, my Hand ſhall puniſh thy unreaſonableneſs with Juſtice.</hi> This ſaid, they parted to give their Horſes a turn. <hi>Staniſlas</hi> being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a ſtately Courſer, came with his Sable in his Hand as if hee would have cleft <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to the twiſt, who riding upon a little <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> Nag, very ſwift and well managed, the nimbleneſs of the Horſe, together with the dexterity of the Rider, rendred the direction of that Thunder blot of no effect: And the Nag being very ready, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the leaſt motion of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Hand, ſo that making a quick turn, hee preſently gained the crupper of <hi>Staniſlas,</hi> and ſheathed his Sword in his Reins, of which wound (being mortall) hee fell immediately from his Horſe. The two Troops that attended on them a loof off, were no ſooner come up to them, but <hi>Staniſlas,</hi> being at the laſt gaſp, ſeemed to remain alive onely to acknowledge his fault, which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all their hearings, hee demanded pardon of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and of the Heavens, after which hee expired, proteſting that nothing was more juſt than Heaven, nothing more unjuſt than his Jealouſie and Choler.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51476:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> This incounter, as that with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> highly augmented the glory of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> even the ſame perſons that accompanied <hi>Staniſlas</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the unjuſtneſs and blindneſs of his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> hearing this, and fearing leſt this Temerity of <hi>Staniſlas</hi> might imbolden other envious perſons to attempt ſome malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> commanded that the Proceſs ſhould be made againſt the memory of the dead Offender, and that his carcaſs ſhould publickly ſuffer the ſhame of an ignominious puniſhment. But <hi>Iphigenes</hi> begging upon his knees before His Majeſty, mitigated the ſeverity of his reſolution, deriving the fault upon <hi>Love</hi> which doth frequently over maſter <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and blind the cleereſt <hi>Judgements.</hi> This increaſed the praiſes of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and made all his deceaſed Enemie's friends profeſs themſelves his ſervants. The <hi>King,</hi> though overcome by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to pardon his Honour, would however make his Eſtate ſuffer, the confiſcation whereof hee gave to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> but hee refuſed it, having not the heart to triumph in ſuch mournfull Spoyls: yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeeing the <hi>King</hi> would beſtow it amongſt his <hi>Courtiers</hi> (who, like Ravens or Kites, do fly greedily at ſuch preys) to preſerve it for the Orphaline, hee accepted it, and took a ſingular care of advancing the poſterity of him, who ſo barbarouſly ſought his Life, rendring, like a Flint, for unkind Blows, the ſparkles of Favour and Courteſie. The Shoulders of the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia</hi> were eaſed of no ſmall burthen by this <hi>Palatine's</hi> Death; for (beſides that it lay heavy upon her, his purſuit being become not onely importunate, but odious to her, ſince ſhee had caſt her Eyes and affections upon the beautifull <hi>Podolian</hi>) ſhee fancied that, beeing watched now no more by that <hi>Dragon,</hi> ſhee ſhould have better opportunity to diſcloſe her intentions, and conduct them to the deſired end. The ſame Death raiſed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Palatine</hi> (which is the higheſt ſtep of honour amongſt the Grandees of <hi>Polonia</hi>) for the <hi>King</hi> requited his innocence, with the inheritance of his unjuſt Adverſaire's Authority. Thus the <hi>Weights</hi> which ſeem to depreſſe the <hi>Palms,</hi> do make them grow up higher; Thus the <hi>Knife</hi> that cut's the <hi>Vines,</hi> maketh them flouriſh, and is cauſe of their producing new Leaves, whoſe Bredth and Beauty do efface the luſter of the antient ſtock.</p>
               <p>As great Tempeſts are preceded by little Winds, which curl the ſmooth-faced Waters, and make the Tree's Leaves tremble; As many little ſtones do tumble from an Houſe-top before the whole building falls; And as extreme Sickneſſes are fore-run bymany ſlight indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51476:34"/> So in great <hi>Prince's</hi> Favorites the declining of their <hi>Fortune</hi> hath it's preſages; and although oftentimes they feel the Thunder-bolt before they ſee the Lightning, yet, to thoſe that have but indifferent judgements, it is eaſie to prejudicate that ſome ſiniſter accident doth threaten them. When Pamphlets, Songs, Advertiſements, Satyres, Poems, and Diffamatory Libells are diſperſed abroad, it is, as when thoſe white Birds are ſeen flying upon the Sea coaſt, which are infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible fore-runners of foulweather. The beautifull Face of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (which betrayed and almoſt accuſed his Heart) was the Rock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equally thoſe that loved, and thoſe that hated him were Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt. It's ſtrange, that Hatred and Love ſhould deduce their Origine from the ſame Principle. That which raviſhed his <hi>Lovers,</hi> made the <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> burſt with Spight; and when <hi>ſome</hi> praiſed exceedingly thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which charmed ſo many Eyes, the <hi>Envious</hi> would take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thence to blame him as being Effeminate: But as Iniquity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtop's its own Mouth, and give's it ſelf the Lye, the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Staniſlas</hi> ſhewed evidently enough the nullity oſ that reproach, and compelled thoſe that called <hi>Iphigenes</hi> a cowardly <hi>Paris,</hi> to acknowledge that Hee was rather to be honoured as a brave <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> who could joyn <hi>Valor</hi> with <hi>Beauty.</hi> Some others (who knew that hee had been Married very yong, and that hee had not proceeded to Conſummation, and beſides, (although the <hi>Ladies</hi> generally were inamored of him) ſeeing that hee repayed their flames with ſuch indifferency) accuſed him of Impotency; For <hi>Courtiers</hi> have that baſe quality, not onely to make little eſteem of Continency them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but blame it in others. Beſides, <hi>Envy</hi> is a Falſe Glaſs, which changeth the Face of Objects, which makes the handſomeſt things ſeem ugly, and chargeth Vertue with the ſame defects that render Vices blameable. It is true, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> the better to conceal what really hee was; would ſometimes play the <hi>Courtier</hi> amongſt the <hi>Ladies,</hi> taking pleaſure to foſter in their Breſts a Diſeaſe, whereunto hee was inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of applying a remedy; and perceiving that divers amongſt them, layed Snares to intrap his Liberty, hee delighted in cutting them out Work, and paying them in the ſame Coyn. What Jealouſies, Quips and petty Quarrels did hee raiſe amongſt that Sex, who are naturally inclined to Self-conceit and Envy? Their hearts were all as Brimſtone to the fire of his Eyes, all as <hi>Heliotropes</hi> or <hi>Turn-ſols</hi> to the Luſter of his Preſence. For, beſides the advantage of being the <hi>King's</hi> Favorite (which is the <hi>North-Star</hi> of thoſe, whoſe hearts are touched with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51476:34"/> the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> of the Court) hee was poſſeſſor of ſo many amiable qualities, that as ſoon as hee fixed his Eyes upon any Lady, ſhee preſently imagined ſhee had caught him, when hee had taken her; and this Opinion raiſing her Fancy to the skies, ſhee thought to triumph over all her Competitors, and be <hi>Queen</hi> of the <hi>Bean,</hi> although ſhee had no part of the <hi>Cake.</hi> For <hi>Iphigenes</hi> changed his diſcourſe ſo often, and knew how to amuſe them all with ſuch dexterity, that although hee loved none, hee ſeemed to conſume at every fire hee approached. This gave Occaſion to ſome malicious Spirits, Jealous of his Glory, to blaſt with their <hi>Satyricall</hi> invectives the bloſſome of his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe ſnarling Curs, who cannot bite <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> do bark after him, caſting ſtones at him without diſcovering their Arms, and making Libells flie about, which the Authors durſt not own but to their ſureſt friends: Others more dangerous, like to the worm that eat's into the <hi>Root</hi> of the green <hi>Ivie,</hi> did ſet their wedges to the <hi>Root</hi> of his <hi>Fortune,</hi> to make the Tree fall down, and ſturck their Pick axes into the Foundation, to undermine the Edifice. Hee that hath been an Homicide from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, hath in all times been buſie in forging Calumnies, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to eſtabliſh <hi>Lyes</hi> in the place of <hi>Truth:</hi> Hee hath alwaies ſowed Darnell amongſt the good grain, and mingled in the pure Gold of the moſt generous Actions, the Ruſt and Skum of falſe Reports and Detraction. The wheel of <hi>Fortune</hi> (like the Potter's) is in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Motion, alwaies framing new Veſſells, ſometimes of Ignominy, ſometimes of Honour, and ſeem's to raiſe thoſe, on whom Shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer's Dignities, meerly to daſh them in pieces by their fall, as Eagles deal with Tortoiſes. This fickle Step-dame (conſtant in nothing but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and who hath nothing certain but her Incertainty) favoring the deſigns of the malicious Enemies of the innocent <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> whom ſhee had till then been elevating to the higheſt point of her Circle, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to their Envie the Invention, if not to work his utter Ruine, at leaſt to make him bee diſcarded from the Court, and ſo, by a Diſgrace, to precipitate him down the hill of his declining Greatneſs. Thus was their Plot, which they ſo cunningly contrived, that thoſe who were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the ſame ſnare never did perceive it. Some Divelliſh Spirits, by means of certain Women (good workers of ſuch wicked Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems) buzzed into the <hi>Queen</hi>'s ears Imaginations, that ought not to enter into the thoughts of ſo diſcreet and ſo vertuous a <hi>Princeſs,</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her that the <hi>King,</hi> in his friendſhip to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> by an <hi>Orientall</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:51476:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> Licentiouſneſs did paſſe the terms of <hi>Honour</hi> and his <hi>Devoir.</hi> This was to touch the <hi>Queen</hi> on the Apple of the Eye, and wound her in the moſt ſenſible place about her: Inſomuch that as thoſe Meats which moſt delight our appetites in health, are the moſt loathſome to us being Sick; ſo the very name of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> on whom ſhee looked ſo favorably beofre this falſe report, hereupon became odious unto her, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence inſupportable. The matchleſs Civilitie, Modeſtie, and chaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure, which formerly ſhee had with leiſure remarked in this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Youth, vaniſhed all in one moment out of her Mind, and the place of Truth was preſently uſurped by falſe Reports and vain ſurmiſes. How eaſie it is in a Woman's heart to ſupplant the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent!</p>
               <p>They had a fairer game to play with the <hi>King:</hi> For the familiarity and free acceſs which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had to the <hi>Queen</hi> and the other Ladies, more than ever was permitted to any other <hi>Favorite,</hi> preſently caſt duſt in the Eyes of his <hi>Reaſon;</hi> And as for the moſt part wee are the laſt that know what is ſayd of us, they made his <hi>Majeſty</hi> believe that every one's mouth was fill'd with the ill deportments of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> to whom moreover they attributed the inſolence of boaſting of Favors, which (though hee had received) hee ought to have kept ſecret; But this (they ſaid) they could not bee induced to believe of a <hi>Princeſs</hi> ſo Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; who had alwaies led ſo exemplary a life as the <hi>Queen;</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that <hi>Greatneſs</hi> was not <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> neither could her <hi>Dignity</hi> hinder her from being a <hi>Woman,</hi> that is, like Chriſtall, the more brittle, the more it is reſplendent. This is the uſuall procedure of all envious Back-biters, they draw their Arms backwards, like Archers, to make their ſhafts enter deeper, feigning not to believe themſelves, what they indeavour to perſwade others: their ſoothing words are as the Oyl, wherein Surgeons uſe to dip the end of their Lancets to render the point more piercing. The <hi>Bed</hi> and the <hi>Throne</hi> admit of no Competitors; in theſe, <hi>Suspicions</hi> are <hi>Oracles,</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> ſeem Lights of <hi>Truth.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>King</hi> (who had by long experience known his Companion, and who did not only believe her, but knew her to bee all white with purity and innocence, beſides, not finding that the moſt venimous nails of <hi>Envy</hi> could make the leaſt impreſſion in the poliſhed Ivory of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as far as hee ever could diſcern) like a prudent and equitable <hi>Prince,</hi> would not decide a cauſe of ſuch importance upon that bare report, leſt hee ſhould thereby fall into Accidents as ſcandalous as full of injuſtice; Much leſs did hee think it ſutable to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> to inform himſelf
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51476:35"/> more particularly in ſuch tickliſh matters, it being an Act of little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to ſeek too curiouſly after that, which one would bee aggrieved to find. But judging (and rightly) that a buſineſs of this Nature ought rather to bee huſhed up than publiſhed, not to offend his own honour, nor give occaſion to any other to bee ſcandalized, Hee thought it more convenient to unſow gently, than rend in pieces Violently: Knowing that if that relation were but a fiction, <hi>Time</hi> (the Father of <hi>Verity</hi>) would diſcover it's <hi>Vanity;</hi> that if thoſe affections were then but beginning, <hi>Abſence</hi> would deracinate them (like young plants) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took too deep root; at the worſt, that it was but caſting Earth upon that Fire, that is, interpoſing a good diſtance of ground betwixt them, <hi>Love</hi>'s power remaining effectleſs in the privation of the <hi>Object.</hi> The expedient which <hi>Prudence</hi> ſuggeſted to him, was to ſend <hi>Iphigenes</hi> from his <hi>Court,</hi> under pretence of taking poſſeſſion of his new <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> where being, Hee would command him to ſtay to acquire credit amongſt his Subjects, and take account of the <hi>Caſtellians,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the <hi>Court</hi> untill further order, which in good tearms is called an Honourable Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>The Storm fell all at once upon the faultleſs <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> by the Eclips of the <hi>Gemini,</hi> the favourable looks of their two <hi>Majeſties;</hi> and, which was very ſtrange, the treachery was deſigned and effected ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that hee could not deviſe who ſhould bee the Artificers, nor, which afflicted him the more, knew the Cauſe of his diſgrace: In that reſpect more miſerable than thoſe Criminalls, who by hearing their Indictment read, are at leaſt informed of the reaſon of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what was moſt of all to be admired, was, that neither the <hi>King</hi> nor the <hi>Queen,</hi> who both agreed in this relegation, did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to each other their Thoughts, which by different projects arrived at the ſame End. Thoſe that have purchaſed <hi>Favour</hi> by Merit, not by Subtilities, have a certain generoſity not common to all <hi>Favorites,</hi> by vertue whereof they deſcend with as much Glory as they were raiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As hee was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51476:36"/> juſt upon the point of fitting his train for his journey into his <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> not complaining as commonly thoſe do, who know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not guilty, or thoſe that leave their Fortunes with Regret; nor ſeeking to juſtifie himſelf, which had been to accuſe his Maſter of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in regard that before <hi>Kings</hi> (in that, <hi>like God</hi>) no juſtification can ſubſiſt, their Diſgrace only being capable to render the moſt Innocent Culpable. It was not without ſome remorſe on the <hi>King</hi>'s part, ſome diſcontentment on the <hi>Queen</hi>'s, and the univerſall ſorrow of the <hi>Court,</hi> that this fair Star was Eclipſed from that Climate, which ſeemed to borrow more leſs luſter from his preſence, than it received from the ſplendor of the <hi>Royaltie.</hi> But Miſchiefs, which ſeldome or never come ſingle, attended <hi>Iphigenes</hi> by the way, to make him alter his Courſe, and try his patience in more than one manner. Being ready to depart, a Meſſenger brought him news of a diſaſter befallen Him, who was the light of his eyes, and for the poſſeſſion of whom hee would not only have left his <hi>Favor</hi> at the <hi>Court,</hi> but willingly have reſigned Scepters and Crowns, which are but Vanities, as Onerous as Honourble. <hi>Liante,</hi> the Object of his thoughts, was made priſoner in one of his Father's Caſtles, and ſo ſtirctly garded, that hee was hardly permitted the liberty to take the Air; which impriſonment was impoſed upon him for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was ſwimming in the full ſtream of <hi>Favor</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi> being the Torment and the Delight of all Eyes &amp; Hearts, and the <hi>Minion</hi> of <hi>Fortune; Liante</hi> plunged in the depth of an inconceivable Melanchollie, as well for the abſence of his dear friend, as to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſtrained (like <hi>Siſyphus</hi>) to rowl an unpleaſing Stone without any relaxation, I mean to wed himſelf to a vocation, which (though hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in it ſelf) was however odious to him, had no other means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his diſcontented thoughts, nor any other poſſibility of releaſing himſelf out of that thraldome, than by flattering his fancy with the the alliance of <hi>Clemencia;</hi> who burning in a mutuall flame for him, did daily (with all the civill reſpects and diſcretion, that could bee deſired of a modeſt and well educated Virgin) render him moſt fervent teſtimonies of her chaſte affection. Although <hi>Love</hi> loveth ſecreſie as the Violets do the ſhade; yet it is eaſie to follow it by the track, and, if it be honourable, to ſmell it a far off by the odour of its parfumes; if it bee otherwiſe, the blackneſs, the ſtinking ſmoak, &amp; the ſhamefull Events that alwaies do ſucceed illicite deſires, will at length make it known. <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> ſleeping in ſecurity as for <hi>Modeſtina's</hi> part by reaſon of <hi>Iphigenes</hi>'s
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51476:36"/> abſence, applied all her care to obſerve the deportments of <hi>Clemencia,</hi> in whom (like a ſubtile Matron) having perceived either by her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, in her Eyes, or her Actions the Tokens of an <hi>Heart</hi> diſtemper'd and taken with ſome Object, like a cunning Hound ſhee followed the ſent ſo cloſe, that in ſhort time ſhee found where the <hi>Hare</hi> had made her <hi>Form,</hi> and diſcovered on which ſide <hi>Clemencia's</hi> Pulſe did beat. The more knowledges hee gained of this ſecret intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence 'twixt her and <hi>Liante,</hi> the more ſhee feined ignorance, like Fiſhers who let their Angles looſe, the better to draw the Fiſhes to them, or drive them genlty into the Leaps, there to make prey of them; Or like Fowlers who ſeem to go away, when they would have the Birds come into their Nets. Indeed how witty and inventive ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever young heads are, it is hard for them to deceive old People; for if their Bodies be decayed with Age, their Spirits beeing refined by Experience, do lead the others to the School of Prudence. In a word, this old Governeſs was too quick-ſighted for our young Lovers; Shee, like an <hi>Owle,</hi> could ſee by Night, that is, in the moſt obſcure corners of their retreats; Shee underſtood the Language of their Looks; Shee could Divine the meaning of their Hearts; Shee clearly ſaw the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of their converſations, whether in the Houſe, ſitting alone in the Gardens, walking in the Fields, or in company; Shee perceived that <hi>Modeſtina</hi> was likewiſe of their intelligence, and that Shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed what ſhee could to the unity of theſe two Hearts, for the contentment of her Brother, whom <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had recommended to her above all things (Alas! with a quite other intention.) But that which made this <hi>Lynx</hi> penetrate into the depth of this Myſtery, was the diſcovery which the reſtleſs old Ferret made of a private place, where our young Lovers were accuſtmed to put their Letters, and ſo interchange their correſpondence without beeing perceived by any. This crafty Female finding them, peruſed them, and then put them into their place again, for they had no other ſeal than a little band of Silk; in regard they were to paſs through no third hand, the ſecrecy of the place ſuffiſed to keep them cloſe. Although <hi>Perpetua</hi> found by a long file of circumſtances, that there was nothing but what was chaſt and honeſt in their pretenſions, ſince all their deſigns did aym at that great <hi>Sacrament,</hi> whoſe ſacred end doth in ſome manner juſtifie all the wayes that do conduct to the accompliſhment of it: yet knowing the deſign of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> which was to make <hi>Liante</hi> eſpouſe an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> like, thereby to draw al the Eſtate to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> by the right of his Wife
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51476:37"/> 
                  <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> and beſides, being advertiſed of the Match, which was in agittion at <hi>Court,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> and <hi>Clemencia,</hi> Shee thought it no leſs than her duty to acquaint <hi>Aretuza</hi> with the ſecret affections of her Daughter and <hi>Liante,</hi> to the end they might be cropt in the Bud, and that ſuch remedies might bee applied as ſhould bee thought moſt convenient. <hi>Aretuza</hi> (who had other thoughts in her mind, knowing that <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> according to the hopes ſhee her ſelf had given him, pretended to <hi>Liante</hi> with a more than ordinary paſſion) was glad of this advice, and being deſirous to break this intelligence, to preſerve <hi>Liante</hi> for <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> Shee forthwith gave <hi>Mieſlas</hi> notice, as alſo did <hi>Perpetua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> (who was Rigour and Barbariſm it ſelf) commanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſeparate thoſe two Lovers, (as if <hi>Hearts</hi> could as eaſily be diſ-joyned as <hi>Bodies</hi>) that <hi>Liante</hi> ſhould be kept ſo cloſe Priſoner in one of his Caſtles (with onely his Tutor and ſuch Servants as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite) that hee might have no poſſibility of continuing his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with <hi>Clemencia,</hi> whom hee had promiſed to the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> and the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> and would have the Marriage concluded with all expedition. This command was no ſoner received but executed, and to the end the Proceſs might be made by Evidences that could not be denied, <hi>Perpetua,</hi> like an hungry <hi>Kite</hi> wheeling too &amp; fro, having pryed out the Cabinet where <hi>Clemencia</hi> kept the Papers ſhee received from <hi>Liante,</hi> one day ſhee fell upon it, and finding the Neſt full of young ones ſhee ſeized on them with her greedy claws. <hi>Liante</hi> was the Father, and <hi>Clemencia</hi> the Mother of them, ſince (as Hens do their Chickens) ſhee kept them under the ſhelter of her Wings. The loſs of thoſe dear Pledges of Affection was reſented by <hi>Clemencia</hi> with ſuch ſorrow, as you may imagine a vertuous Virgin would conceive beeing ſurpriſed in that manner. <hi>Liante's</hi> Tutour having received inſtructions from <hi>Perpetua</hi> did the like to his Pupill, which caſt him into ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, as no words an expreſs; And to heap up the meaſure of his ſorrow, hee ſaw himſelf debarred of the preſence of Her (whoſe ſweet Diſpoſition and Fidelity Hee had more reaſon to love, than Her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereof <hi>Nature</hi> had been but ſparing to her) and not onely that, but confined to a Priſon, which was no leſs odious to him, than the cauſe of his impriſonment was unjuſt. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> received intelligence of all theſe paſſages from <hi>Aretuza,</hi> who knew that if this rigorous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did diſlike him in one reſpect, it would be pleaſing to him on the other, ſince it did put an obſtacle to that Alliance, which might have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51476:37"/> been prejudicall to his deſign. But <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (who was grown ſo Rich and ſo Great, that the advantage of <hi>Roſuald's</hi> Inheritance was nothing conſiderable to him, and who loved <hi>Liante</hi> with a Love of perfect Friendſhip, that is, with an affection ſo free from Intereſts, that it aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at no other end, than the good of the perſon beloved) though glad on the one ſide to ſee that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ſo played his Game, as to ſtop the current of <hi>Liante's</hi> and <hi>Clemencia's</hi> correſondence, was much grieved on the other for the captivity of his dear Brother-in-law, whoſe liberty hee reſolved to procure ſome way or other, though to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his own contentment. This was the occaſion, that before hee went into his own <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Vratiſlaü,</hi> hee demanded leave of His Majeſty to go firſt into <hi>Podolia,</hi> under pretence of taking his Wife along with him into his Government; which requeſt was ſo reaſonable that there was no Probability of its beeing ſubject to a Deniall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> knowing of his Son's Deſign to go into <hi>Podolia,</hi> and fearing, amongſt divers other things, the Conſummation of his Marriage with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (which hee had leaſt reaſon of all to apprehend) and leſt by the importunities of his Wife, Hee ſhould be conſtrained to give <hi>Liante</hi> his liberty, and not onely that, but alſo to confirm the Match betwixt him and <hi>Clemencia,</hi> as hee had formerly ſeemed to deſire; All which was extreamly contrary to the Reſolutions, which hee had made with the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> concerning the double alliance of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Fearing, I ſay, all theſe events ſeverally, and much more, beeing put together, Hee employed all his Power and Rhetorick to diſſwade his Son from going into <hi>Podolia,</hi> counſelling him punctually to obey the <hi>King's</hi> command, which was, to retire into his own <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Vratiſlaü:</hi> But his hopes were, that hee beeing far diſtant from <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> Time, the great Worker of Oblivion, might purge his Heart of that Paſſion, and diſpoſe him to the Nuptialls of <hi>Simphoroza:</hi> But all his Intreaties, all his Perſwaſions could not induce <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to change his Determination; And although divers times, according to his haughty humour, hee would thuder out ſome imperious Language, and expreſs himſelf in tearms that witneſſed his Diſpleaſure, yet hee durſt not attribute too much to his Fatherly Authority, his Son beeing (according to the World) as Great, and in ſome reſpects Greater and Richer than himſelf. But what did hee? whether according to the dictates of his own Diſpoſition (as Cruell as Covetous) or whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by the ſuggeſtions of the crafty <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> to prevent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51476:38"/> the miſchief which Hee apprehended, Hee ſent with all expedition a command to commit <hi>Modeſtina</hi> cloſe Priſoner in another of his Caſtles, (but far ſtronger than where the afflicted <hi>Liante</hi> was) to hinder his Son, even to the extremity, from enjoying that Wife, which hee was reſolved to take from him, and place <hi>Simphoroza</hi> in her room, under whoſe Infantine Countenance <hi>Reſpicia</hi> did hide her own full-grown deſires.</p>
               <p>It is a generall Maxime at <hi>Court</hi> as well as in <hi>War,</hi> that a Man fails but once, as Hee can fall but once that tumbles from an high precipice (for at the firſt falling one's ſure to break his neck;) the <hi>Favour</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> holding ſomewhat of the Nature of the bone in an Horſe's Leg, which being once broken can never bee well ſet again. For <hi>Monarks</hi> do imagine that they never do any body wrong, and that the moſt innocent are culpable, if they conceive but the leaſt ſuſpition againſt them. That if by evident proofs they are brought to acknowledge their unjuſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, inſtead of repenting (as if they were impeccable) they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, (although by a re-eſtabliſhment they ſalve the ſore of the offended party) that the Cicatrice will yet remain, which leaves a ſenſe of the injury, like that of the <hi>Goddeſs Juno,</hi> irritated by the judgement of <hi>Paris,</hi> who could never be reconciled. But all theſe <hi>Axiomes</hi> were contradicted in this diſmiſſion of <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> for never was any Diſgrae more Gracious, Disfavour more Favorable, Misfortune more Fortunate, nor Exilement more Gentle. Oh! how highly would hee have obliged the <hi>King</hi> (if <hi>Kings</hi> can be obliged) whoſoever could have deviſed ſome honorable expedient to retein <hi>Iphigenes!</hi> But the Plot was contrived againſt him with ſuch ſubtility, that neither the <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Queen</hi> (though they had deſired it) knew which way to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. For although they both perceived the innocence of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> as clearly as the Sun is to be ſeen at Noon-day (if there had been no other proof than his leaving the <hi>Court</hi> with ſo little ſhew of diſguſt;) yet their Honours were equally ingaged to ſuffer his departure, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the reciprocall umbrages of ſuſpition, wherein the malice of his Enemies had ſo cunningly involved them, that the <hi>King</hi> knew not that the <hi>Queen</hi> had any Jealouſie of him, neither did Shee imagine that Hee had any diffidence of Her; for neither of them made the leaſt ſhew of any diſcontent; their Tongues beeing, as it were, Inchanted with the charm of <hi>Calumny,</hi> could not communicate the conceptions of their Hearts. But when they conſidered that the <hi>Crown</hi> was in a manner falling from their heads, <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> or (as I may ſay) the <hi>Court</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:51476:38"/> of their <hi>Court,</hi> beeing to take his leave, they could not but reſent the compunctions of ſorrow for that ſeparation: however they ſwallowed that draught not ſo much to pleaſe their taſtes, as for their health, ſince that <hi>Abſence</hi> was to be the Medicine to cure their diſeaſed <hi>Minds,</hi> and ſerve as a Touch-ſtone to the Truth, to diſcern Impoſtures.</p>
               <p>Never wasy any departure ſo glorious as that of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> you would have ſaid that hee went to put the <hi>Court</hi> into a Sepulcher, and that it was the Funerall of the publick Joy; if the Mourning appeared not in the apparrell, it was in the People's Hearts, which is far more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall. The <hi>King</hi> himſelf, (when hee came to kiſs his Hands) diſcovered in his Countenance moſt evident ſigns of Sorrow, not as repenting that hee had raiſed his <hi>Fortune,</hi> but that hee had ſo diſcarded him: And taking him aſide, he ſpent ſome time in Diſcourſe, guilding that Pill, &amp; Sugring that <hi>Ruburb,</hi> to make him ſwallow it with the leſs difficulty, Telling him <hi>That hee muſt give way to the Torrent of Envy, for fear it ſhould ruine all that oppoſed its fury; That it was a part of Wiſdom to yeild rather than to withſtand it; That indeed hee had many Detractours, but all their reports did make no more impreſſion in his thoughts, than a Stone in a running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Hee promiſed to recall him er'e long, proteſting <hi>That it grieved him to ſuffer him any time out of his preſence, however hee would have him think that it was not to disparage him, but to authorize him the more, giving him the means to purchaſe Credit and Eſteem in his Government, which might one day bee uſefull for the ſervice of his Crown; That hee uſed him like a Father, that ſend's his Son to Academies in ſtrange Countries, to learn the Art of living in the School of the World, and return with more knowledge Home.</hi> Moreover, in token of his reall Affection, hee gave him as great Preſents, as ever hee had done formerly, commanding his Treaſurers to defray all the charges of his Journy, and giving his <hi>Courtiers</hi> to underſtand, that thoſe who would accompany <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in Complement out of the City, would do him a Pleaſure, and thoſe that would attend him all the way, would do a Service as acceptable as if rendred to his own Perſon.</p>
               <p>To all this <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> confounded with ſo many ſignall Favours, could make no diſtinct anſwer; yet the confuſion of his Speech, and the throbbing of his Heart, with the colours of <hi>Vertue,</hi> which rendred his Face more beautifull than that of <hi>Aurora,</hi> when ſhee riſeth under a ſerene Sky, furniſhed him with a Diſcourſe that ſurpaſſed the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of any Tongue; whereunto if you add that moving and fluent Language, which iſſueth out of the Eyes, when bathed with Tears, there
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51476:39"/> is no charm in all the Art of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> can parallel this manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: for 'tis the Heart that ſpeaks in bleeding through the Eyes. What <hi>Iphigenes?</hi> do you play the <hi>Woman?</hi> Ha! Are you not afraid to bee diſcovered? certainly <hi>Vliſſes</hi> knew that <hi>Achilles,</hi> under a <hi>Woman's</hi> habit, was a <hi>Man,</hi> by Tokens leſs evident. At length Sighs &amp; Sobs having made way for Words, hee thus replied; <hi>Your</hi> Majeſty <hi>looking on mee as a Creature of your own making, would be ſorry to undoe that work of your Hands, therefore you are pleaſed to ſurcharge me with ſo many Favours, and heap ſuch multitudes of benefits upon mee, that in despight of my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I muſt die Ingratefull to your exceeding Muniſicence; but that spot can be no blemiſh to mee, ſeeing that it is the will which acknowledgeth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and payeth in ſome kind by Deſire, what it cannot in Effect.</hi> Sir, <hi>you know how often I have beſeeched you to moderate the Favours and Grace (wherewith your Liberality over-loaded mee) not to offend the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Eye of Envy, who not meaſuring Preſents by the Greatneſs of the Giver, but by the Meanneſs of the Receiver, cannot endure that</hi> Kings <hi>ſhould exalt thoſe who have the happineſs to gain their Favour, to the prejudice of their Capricious Humours, which make them find nothing to their minds. As Envy is diſpleaſing to all the World, ſo all the World diſpleaſeth it, all hands are againſt it, and it's hand is againſt the moſt innocent. I ſhould take glory in its Malice, for thence I might derive an occaſion to preſume of having ſome vertue, ſince that is the common Object of its malign practiſes; But I muſt confeſs that in ſeparating mee from the preſence of Your</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, <hi>it hath found the means to wound me in the moſt tender part, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſecret to put my Patience to the harſheſt triall that I could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. For there is no</hi> Grandeur, <hi>no Riches that I would not trample under my feet as Dung. So that I might but remain neer Your</hi> Majeſty, <hi>and all is but Dirt and Aſhes to me in your abſence. The Colours which they have choſen to baniſh me from your</hi> Court, <hi>are very ſpecious; This is to purſue me with Roſes and Flowers, to perſecute mee in caſting Oranges and Vialls of ſweet Waters at mee; It is to cut off my Head with a Blade of Gold, or ſtrangle mee with a Silken Halter. I do not queſtion,</hi> Sir, <hi>the reaſon of my Exile, it ſuffiſeth, that it is your Pleaſure, to perſwade mee that it is Juſt; if you would command mee to go meet Death, you ſhould ſee mee run head-long to obey you, although I were moſt certain that I had not deſerved it. Were it in my choyce, I ſhould freely ſay to your Greatneſs, Bee pleaſed to take from mee what your immenſe Liberality hath hitherto powred upon my head. But ſince your Ordinance is otherwiſe, and that, burthened with Benefits, I muſt leave the Source for the Rivulets, and bee removed hence for the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51476:39"/> advancement of your affairs and ſervice (without conſidering the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to my Honour, or the joy, I will not ſay, of my enemies, (for I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured as much as in mee lay not to purchaſe any) but of thoſe that are jealous of the Graces I have received from your Goodneſs) I am willing to deprive my ſelf, as long as your</hi> Majeſty <hi>ſhall pleaſe, of the glory of your preſence, in teſtimony of my extream Obedience and Fidelity, protesting that I had rather Die at your feet, than Live far from you in all the honours and delights Imaginable.</hi> This diſcourſe interrupted ſometimes with Sobs, and accompanyed with Tears, as pittifull as the Grief, which produced them, was reall, ſo moved the <hi>King's</hi> generous Spirit, that hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the mind to repeal <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Baniſhment. But humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the reaſons already declared, prevailed above his Affection; ſhewing therein his great vertue by ſubduing himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> after this, (with the <hi>King</hi>'s permiſſion) went to take leave of the <hi>Queen,</hi> who (like a woman,) knew better how to diſſemble her regret, but not retein her tears, whoſe flowing betrayed her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which ſhee had framed to Gravity and Diſdain; So that at length ſhee was inforced to leave off that borrowed Viſard, and ſhew openly enough to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that ſhee loſt in him (not without reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the richeſt Ornament of her <hi>Court,</hi> but that the <hi>King</hi> making her hope that his abſence ſhould not bee long, ſhee comforted her ſelf with the expectation of his return, wiſhing him all happineſs in his Journey, and recommending him to continue in the fidelity, which hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies expreſt in his <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s ſervice, who had obliged him thereunto by ſo many gracious favours. Whereunto <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with a cheerfull and confident look, replyed, MADAM, <hi>Since after ſo many glorious dayes ſpent under the heaven of your</hi> Court, <hi>in the preſence of your Favour, I muſt plunge, or rather bury my ſelf alive in the obſcurity of a tedious abſence: my Reaſon more powerfull than my Senſes, forbid's mee to complain, and denying utterance to my Sorrow, rendreth it ſo much the more miſerable, the leſs it dare's discloſe it's Agonie. Since afer ſo many graces received, and ſo many others that I hoped to receive from your</hi> Royall <hi>Beneficence, there is a neceſſity of my experimenting the Rain after the fair weather, and Thorns after the Roſes, I can do no leſs than extoll the high</hi> Providence <hi>of</hi> Heaven, <hi>which deſtinying mee to Misfortune after ſo many humane Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, hath ordeined that my Chaſtiſement proceed's from the ſame hands that have made mee what I am, and from whom I have received greater benefits than I was ever able to deſerve, If my Affection to ſerve your</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <hi>ſupply not the place of Merit. Indeed the Excellency of the Cauſe,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51476:40"/> make's mee rather applaud than condemn the Rigor of the Effect. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Sorrow may be allowed to utter words rather free than deſperate, permit mee,</hi> MADAM, <hi>to ſay with all due reſpect to your</hi> Majeſty, <hi>that if I have any way failed in the Honour or Fidelity that can be required from the moſt humble ſubjection and ſervitude; If I have deviated in the leaſt from my</hi> Devoir, <hi>after the reception of ſo many Gratifications, there is no torment cruell enough to inflict upon ſuch a Monſter of Ingratitude. Baniſhment is too Mild, &amp; ſuch a one as is procured mee, too Honourable for a Puniſhment which ought to bee more Exemplary. But why do I speak, having proteſted to ſuffer in Silence? I belye my own propoſition, and fly into complaints, which cannot appear juſt without doing injury to your Prudence and Equity. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> MADAM, <hi>the vehemencie of my ſorrow, ſince, ſeeing my ſelf torn from the</hi> King, <hi>my Maſter, whoſe preſence and favour I eſteem more than my life, I feel my Heart rend in pieces, and my Soul ſeperate from my Body. What Trophies will my Enviers raiſe to their Malignity, ſeeing their deſigns which aym at nothing but my ruine, take effect? What Vanity will puffe up their poiſonous Minds, that they have had the power to infect ſuch clear Judgements as your</hi> Majeſtie's, <hi>making their Calumnies prevail againſt my Innocencie? But if ſuffiſeth that it is your Will, I most humbly ſubmit to the abſolute Power you have over my Life, my Death, my Honour and my Fortune; for, being your Creature you may diſpoſe of mee, as the Potter of his Clay, forming mee, according to your own pleaſure, into a Veſſell of Magnificence or Ignominie. I am ready to condemn my Innocency, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhall pronounce it guilty, and to ſubſcribe my accuſation without replying: And if you pleaſe to dictate the Sentence of my Death, I will write and ſign it with my Blood, and willingly fulfill your decree with the loſs of my Life: For, preſerving it for no other end, than to employ it in your</hi> Majeſtie's <hi>ſervice, I cannot loſe it more honorably, nor more advantagiouſly than to content you. But ſince your</hi> Majeſties <hi>have otherwiſe determined, and that I am reſerved to live, that my Life may be as a lingring Death to mee, I will yeild ſhamefully to thoſe who procure my Diſgrace, chooſing rather to faile by a faint hearted Obedience, than defend my ſelf with a rebellious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. Perhaps one day the Light may ſhine through the Darkneſs, and that</hi> Time, <hi>which maketh evident the moſt hidden things, drawing Truth out of the bottom of the Well, may render mee worthy to appear again before your</hi> Majeſty <hi>with ſo much Advantage, that my preſent Dammage will ſeem as the ſeed of my future Prosperity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Imagine you if the <hi>Queen,</hi> being a vertuous and mercifull <hi>Princeſs,</hi> and a Woman, of a tender Diſpoſition and ſuſceptible of Compaſſion,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51476:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> could hear this long diſcourſe without being ſomwhat moved. So, for his farther ſatisfaction ſhee gave him to underſtand, <hi>That ſhee had been informed by the</hi> King, <hi>that this ſending him into his Government was not intended through any diſlike of theirs, but for reaſons which regarded the</hi> State <hi>and the ſervice of their</hi> Crown: <hi>Aſſuring him that for her part ſhee had no prejudiciall oinion of him, not ſuffering her ſelf eaſily to bee carried away by ſlight ſuppoſitions and falſe reports, (which like importunate wasps are alwaies buzzing at the ears of</hi> Princes;) <hi>that hee might remain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wherein ſhee could procure him any advantage, or do him any good office to her Husband and</hi> Sovereign, <hi>that ſhee would indeavour it with a ſincere affection.</hi> To theſe <hi>words,</hi> which were worth mountains of Gold, ſhee added no <hi>preſents,</hi> becauſe <hi>thoſe</hi> paſs away, but <hi>theſe</hi> remain, and being more materiall give more occaſion of Suſpition, from which ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to keep her ſelf as fre as ſhee was from Crime. Thus <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in an unheard-of manner, was diſmiſſed from <hi>Court,</hi> with extraordinary Careſſes from both their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> and (which was admirable) not diſſembled. To demand permiſſion to paſs through <hi>Podolia,</hi> to take his wife thence with him into his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to obtein it, was all one. The Courtiers, thoſe <hi>Protheuſſes,</hi> who change according to the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Prince,</hi> made (in imitation of the <hi>King</hi>) a thouſand compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and large expreſſions of ſorrow, when ſome of their hearts leaped with joy at his departure.</p>
               <p>The falſe accuſers of <hi>Socrates, Anitus</hi> and <hi>Melitus,</hi> ſeeing the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall mourning of the <hi>Athenians</hi> for the death of that great <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> being haunted with <hi>Furies,</hi> and tortured with the remorſe of their own Conſciences, became their own Executioners. The Calumniators of our <hi>Favorite,</hi> were upon the point of giving themſelves over to the like rage; but they did more wiſely to reſerve themſelves to a better end by repentance. Thoſe who thought to have pleaſed their <hi>Majeſties</hi> in not accompanying <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> found themſelves deceived in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, receiving as little Countenance from the <hi>King,</hi> as they ſhewed little Courteſie to him: And thoſe who did that civility to him, were favourably looked upon at their return: But how were they eſteemed and applauded that rendring themſelves his conſtant followers, became partakers of his adverſe, as well as of his favorable <hi>Fortune?</hi> They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the ſenſe of this common ſaying, <hi>The Fortunate are oppreſſed with Multitudes, and Solitarineſs environeth the Miſerable.</hi> Some <hi>Flies</hi> &amp; now and then a <hi>Swallow</hi> is ſeen in <hi>winter,</hi> and their rarity maketh them the more remarkable. Thoſe who abandon not their friends when <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:51476:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> knits her brows, ſhew they are not led on by intereſt, but that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the perſons beloved doth attract them. This apparent diſgrace of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> did nothing diminiſh the ardent flames of the paſſionate <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Reſpicia,</hi> all that troubled her was his ominous Journey into <hi>Podolia,</hi> which ſeemed to threaten the ſhipwrack of her pretenſions. What will not a heart reſolve being touched with that fire, which breeds the greater torment the more it is concealed? To hinder the Conſummation of his Marriage with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (which <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had already prevented) ſhee determined to follow <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Mieſlas</hi> into <hi>Podolia,</hi> under pretence of affiancing the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> with <hi>Clemencia,</hi> and to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perſwade <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to marry her Daughter <hi>Simphoroza,</hi> though there was nothing more far from her intention than the latter. If <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> had permitted, ſhee would have put her ſelf amongſt that troop of Courtiers that accompanyed <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> amongſt whom the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> was the firſt in quality and in rank, taking this occaſion to aſſiſt his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Brother-in-law, and ſee his Miſtreſs. The brave <hi>Pomeran,</hi> invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably wedded to the fortune of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> was likewiſe of the number: As alſo <hi>Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides</hi> (who being a Lord <hi>Caſtellain</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Vratiſlaü,</hi> and of an antient family, reſolved to employ all his own means, and uſe the utmoſt of his friend's power to ſerve <hi>Iphigenes</hi> after his arrivall in his Government;) Beſides a great train of other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen of <hi>Podolia,</hi> that returned from <hi>Court</hi> with <hi>Mieſlas. Iphigenes</hi> in this pompous retirement was like a certain ſort of Tapers, which compoſed of <hi>Aromaticall</hi> ingredients, exhale not ſo much ſweet odor burning, as when extinguiſhed, or <hi>Incenſe</hi> which ſmoaketh not untill put on the coals, and ſpices that render no ſent untill they are beaten. This I ſay, becauſe the reputation of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was greater in his abſence than in his preſence, Privation making the injoyment of him more valuable. And as a Beard grows thicker after ſhaving, ſo his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown increaſed under the Razor of Detraction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> being entred into his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> made his Son bee received with the greateſt delights and honours that hee could deviſe, but it was to make him taſte Gall after this Honey, &amp; give him an <hi>after courſe</hi> not conformable to this <hi>firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Service;</hi> for, being arrived at the place of his reſidence, hee neither found his wife <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> nor his Brother-in-law <hi>Liante</hi> with <hi>Aretuza,</hi> whereat hee expreſſed no ſlight diſcontent. And although by an eſpeciall providence of <hi>Heaven, Mieſlas</hi> had incloſed <hi>Modeſtina</hi> in a place inacceſſible by any force (which might ſerve for a ſpecious pretext to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to keep hid the defect which hindred him
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51476:41"/> from acting the husband really) yet hee feined to bee very ſenſible of the injury they did him in debarring him of the poſſeſſion of Her, whom hee could not injoy in that quality hee pretended, by reaſon of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles which <hi>Nature</hi> had impoſed at his Creation. His Mother to whom hee communicated all his deſignes, could not enough admire with what grace and induſtry hee concealed his condition, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled the Eyes of ſuch quick-ſighted overſeers. Whileſt hee fumed and raged to have his Wife releaſed (towards whom, if they had granted his requeſt, hee knew not how to behave himſelf as a Husband) <hi>Mieſlas</hi> oppoſed the rigor of his Fatherly Authority, alleadging, That <hi>his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was made before the time,</hi> that <hi>the conſentment of the parties at ſuch tender years could bee but imperfect, and therefore hee held it as nothing;</hi> that <hi>the face of things being changed, hee did revoke the conſent which hee had given to that Contract, having ſince ingaged his word to the</hi> Princeſs Reſpicia. Then, being further importuned to ſet <hi>Modeſtina</hi> at liberty, hee threatned his Son with fearfull maledictions, if ever hee took her as his Wife. Hereupon <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> handſomely feining Scruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſeemed to apprehend leſt his Father'<hi>s</hi> curſes ſhould light upon his Poſterity, and abſolutely ruine his Fortune, which already was ſhrewdly ſhaken; Inſomuch that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> perceiving that this battery made breach in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Soul mounted no other Artillery, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other Thunderbolts to reduce all his indeavours unto aſhes.</p>
               <p>In the heat of theſe conteſtations arrived the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> bringing her Daughter <hi>Simphoroza,</hi> whoſe age being yet too neer Infancy, was incapable, for certain years, of bearing <hi>Hymen</hi>'s yoke. At her coming (as at the appearance of <hi>Porpoſes</hi> a Tempeſt is obſerved to follow) <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſlas</hi> began again to ſtorm and torment <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to marry <hi>Simphoroza.</hi> Hee alleadged for excuſe his Faith given to <hi>Modestina,</hi> that whom <hi>God</hi> hath joyned, men could not ſeparate, that nothing but <hi>death</hi> ſhould break the Bands that united his heart to her's; beſides, hee would have perſwaded them that hee had in a manner paſſed to a perfect Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and that ſhee was not only his wife by words but in effect: But this was contradicted by <hi>Perpetua</hi> and <hi>Modeſtina</hi> her ſelf, whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent depoſition declared that ſhee never knew what Man was. <hi>Respicia</hi> knowing, that as in Naturall things the Corruption of the one, is the Generation of another; So in affairs, the Rupture of one, is the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of another, urged nothing ſo eagerly as the Diſſolution of this firſt Marriage.</p>

But they were to ſeek what to reply, when to their confuſion their deciſion rebounded in their own faces; For, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> readily preſented to them that <hi>Simphoroza</hi> was of years, not only incapable to conſummate the marriage, but to give a full and perfect conſent, without which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own argument) that knot could not be rendred indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. Hereupon the <hi>Princeſs Respicia</hi> made appear the ſubtility of her wit, feigning, what ſhee deſired with impatience, to Subrogate her ſelf in the place of her Daugher. This ſhee intimated to <hi>Mieſlas</hi> with ſo much Artifice, and ſuch Prodigious advantages for <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (for the moſt part of the Eſtate came by her) that the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia,</hi> naturally deſirous of wealth to maintein his exceſſive expences, was preſently induced to hearken to her perſwaſions. On that ſide the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was as ſoon concluded as propounded; but they foreſaw much
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51476:43"/> difficulty to make the young Gentleman bite at this Golden Bait; for his own Eſtate was ſo plentifull, and his Honours ſo great, that how vaſt ſoever the Fortune of <hi>Reſpicia</hi> could bee, and how illuſtrious her Alliance; if the Appaſt (which youthly Palates do reliſh with moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs) compoſed of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> were wanting, it muſt needs bee imagined that hee would not eaſily be drawn into that Marriage, as unequall for years on the one ſide as on the other: For, as <hi>Simphoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was too young, and her tender Beauty, being not yet full blown, did promiſe no great matter in the Bud; So her Mother was too old, though not ſo aged as to bee rejected for ugly, nor ſo young as to bee rank'd amongſt the Beautifull: Shee was in that Point as Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to leave the Attribute of <hi>Fair,</hi> to enter into the Predicament of <hi>Good.</hi> But beeing very Artificiall, ſhee had the Induſtry (without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that ſhee Painted) advantageouſly to repair the dammages which Age had done to her Preſence, and doting upon her own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Shee gave ſuch credit to the falſe Reports of her Looking. Glaſs, that ſhee fancied her ſelf to bee the moſt lovely Creature breathing.</p>
               <p>IPHIGENES making a Buckler, againſt his Father's Importunities, of the Child-hood of <hi>Simphoroza, Mieſlas</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>And if I find you another Match Richer than ſhee, and of mature Age, will you accept of her?</hi> Hereupon <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (to whom all Women were alike, for any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hee had to do with them) to counterfeit the obedient Son, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring out of Compliment, <hi>That</hi> hee had no other Will then his, ſo that hee would pleaſe to give him time to know before hee Loved, there beeing nothing in the World ſo hard to do by <hi>Force,</hi> or in reſpect of <hi>Duty,</hi> as to <hi>Love. Mieſlas,</hi> raviſhed with this Act of Obedience, after acknowledgement of the Immortall Obligations Hee would do him, if hee would leave <hi>Modeſtina</hi> to marry one of the nobleſt and moſt opulent Ladies of <hi>Polonia</hi> (beeing leſſoned before hand by the ſubtile <hi>Reſpicia</hi>) propoſed by a thouſand crafty circumlocutions the <hi>Mother</hi> in ſtead of the <hi>Daughter;</hi> and ſetting out her <hi>Beauty</hi> (like flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Painters) with the Penſill of his Tongue, and magnifying her <hi>Riches</hi> with the Eloquence of a mouth of Gold, hee indeavoured to provoke <hi>Iphigenes</hi> appetite to reliſh that ſtale Fruit, and make him take a commodity that was not for his utterance. A modeſt bluſh covering his delicate Cheeks at the recitall of this Propoſition; <hi>What?</hi> ſayd Mieſlas, <hi>you do like thoſe fooliſhly nice Virgins that are daſht out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, when one ſpeake's to them of a Husband. Indeed your Enviers at</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:51476:43"/> Court <hi>were miſtaken in the tearm, when they called you Effeminate, ſince you make ſo little account of Women, as to bluſh with ſhame when they are but mentioned. Truly</hi> Sir, replyed IPHIGENES (the Bloud riſing faſter in his Face, becauſe his Father had taken notice of that Girliſh Action) <hi>me think's (as that Ancient who would not be perſwaded to marry, anſwered thoſe that urged him thereunto in his youth, that it was yet too ſon, and in his old Age, that it was then too late) I may freely ſay,</hi> that <hi>as it is not yet time for the</hi> Daughter <hi>to dream of Marrying, ſo it is more than time that the</hi> Mother <hi>ſhould leave ſuch thoughts; the one is too young, the other too far advanced in years (for the word Old is injurious to that Sex,) and both of them (if I have any Judgement) are very unfit for mee: I have Riches and Honours more than I need, &amp; beeing by favour of Fate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you, the alliance of a Wife can adde nothing to the nobleneſs of my Extraction, nor of my Poſterity. In Marriage is required not onely an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Fortune, but the equality of Age and Humours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe ſo diſpleaſed the arrogant <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who invoking Heaven and Earth againſt his <hi>Son,</hi> loaded his Rebellion with Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and fulminated a thouſand execrable curſes againſt his Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; <hi>Iphigenes</hi> feigning to be affraid of thoſe Threats and terrible Thunder-claps of his <hi>Father's</hi> wrath, beſeeched him to pardon him, if hee had declared his ſenſe ſo plainly, knowing <hi>that</hi> the firſt <hi>Ideas</hi> are generally but little Judicious, and <hi>how</hi> the firſt Motions are not in our Powers. <hi>That</hi> Reaſon did oblige him to acknowledge the Beauty, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and Eminent advantages of the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia;</hi> but that the <hi>Senſe</hi> ſurpriſing for the moſt part the <hi>Judgement,</hi> it arrives oft-times <hi>that</hi> upon ſecond thoughts wee deſire with ardour, what at the firſt we too inconſideratly rejected: <hi>That</hi> He knew Matrimony to be ſo ſage a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that therein was not to bee given ſo much acceſs to <hi>Appetite</hi> as to <hi>Prudence; That</hi> great Perſonages ought to hearken thereunto more out of <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> than for the conſideration of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> hee did deſire onely ſome time to reflect ſeriouſly thereupon, and give his reſolution. This ſatisfaction being ſpeedily applied to the wound in <hi>Mieſlas</hi> his cholerick breſt, took away all the pain and inflamation in a moment.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had the full liberty of his thoughts, I give you leave to Judge what his Imaginations were of <hi>Reſpicia's</hi> Deſigns, all whoſe deportments repaſſing through his Memory, hee eaſily gathered by her former Diſcourſes to him at the <hi>Court,</hi> that beeing inamored of the Beauty which appeared in his Face, ſhee had diſguiſed her <hi>own</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51476:44"/> under the Marriages of her <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Daughter;</hi> and then making reflection further upon the weakneſs of a Sex accompanied with ſuch cunning Plots, hee regretted that <hi>Nature</hi> having indued his <hi>Mind</hi> with ſuch a Maſculine Courage, had ranked his <hi>Body</hi> in ſo miſerable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: At laſt, reſolving never to deceive any other Woman than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtina,</hi> and in regard if hee married <hi>Respicia,</hi> his Secret would ſoon bee divulged, hee thought it moſt conducing to his purpoſe, to thruſt back <hi>Time</hi> by the Shoulders, and amuſe her with delayes. This Deſign hee imparted to <hi>Aretuza,</hi> who much approved his ingenuity; and you may gueſs, if knowing (as they did) the truth of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Diſguiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had not occaſion enough to make their Paſtime of the <hi>Princeſſe's</hi> Pain: Who being full of Vanity, ſeeing her ſelf Courted by <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with ſome little ſhew of Paſſion, conceited preſently that, <hi>Baſilisk</hi> like, ſhee had wounded him in the Eyes; which Opinion tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her into follies more extravagant than can been imagined; But I will leave them at the end of my Pen, not to verifie this ſaying of a certain Author, <hi>That there is nothing more ridiculous than a decrepite Souldier and an aged Lover.</hi> Mean time <hi>Iphigenes</hi> protracted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his reſolution, having his brains more troubled about procuring the liberty of his dear <hi>Liante.</hi> To demand that grace of his Father upon the nick of <hi>Clemencia's</hi> Marriage to the <hi>Prince Caſſin,</hi> were to put him quite off the hooks; beſides, to break that affection between his Siſter and that beloved Brother-in-Law, hee thought it materiall, firſt to let that Alliance betwixt the <hi>Prince</hi> and her bee fully concluded, wherein <hi>Mieſlas</hi> did labour all hee could.</p>
               <p>Wee have already ſaid that <hi>Clemencia</hi> injoyed not ſo much outward Beauty, as inward Vertue; and that if <hi>Liante</hi> had any Inclination for Her, it was, becauſe Obliged by her Affection &amp; Cordiality to him. But <hi>Caſſin,</hi> who had ſeen ſo many objects at <hi>Court</hi> more worthy to ſtay his thoughts, did look upon her meerly to pleaſe his Mother, and to ſatisfie the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſire Hee had of raiſing himſelf to high Commands by the ſupport and favour of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who beeing then retired from the <hi>Court,</hi> which is the <hi>Country</hi> of Occaſions, and the <hi>Field</hi> where Dignities are reaped, this made the <hi>Prince</hi> more cold in his purſuit. Nevertheleſs having imbarked himſelf in that Voyage, and being advanced to offers of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Her, and Tearms of Agreement with <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> there was no poſſibility of his receding, without offending the <hi>Palatine,</hi> who had given Him his Word, and to whom Hee had reciprocally paſſed His. Beſides that, His Mother, who was entred into ſome hope of poſſeſſing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51476:44"/> 
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (which Shee kept cloſe enough from His knowledge) egged Him daily on to finiſh that Treaty. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> on the other ſide (beeing importuned by <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to the re-ſearch, or more properly, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of <hi>Reſpicia</hi>) found an expedient, (for his own reſpect) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinate that buſines; which was thus.</p>
               <p>His Marriage with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> had been celebrated publickly and with Solemnity; therefore for his own Juſtification, and the good of his Poſterity, it was requiſite that it ſhould bee declared void by publick Authority; for the effecting whereof they muſt have recourſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> Hee beeing of Opinion that in mean time they ſhould proceed to the accompliſhment of his Siſter's Marriage to <hi>Caſſin. That ſhall be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance,</hi> replied Mieſlas, <hi>if that be all:</hi> And <hi>Respicia,</hi> more glad than if ſhee had gained an Empire, could not hold her Heart from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for joy aſſoon as Shee heard this news flattering her ſelf that to Demand and Obtain that Diſſolution was but one and the ſame thing. Whileſt the Meſſenger was poſting to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Parents laboured to effect the Marriage of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Clemencia:</hi> But the mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Parties, beeing that which faſten'<hi>s</hi> the Knot, it was traverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſiſtance of <hi>Clemencia,</hi> who refuſed to ſubſcribe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, declaring freely to her Father, that <hi>her Heart was</hi> Liante's, <hi>and that ſhee would bee wedded to a Cloiſter with her Elder Siſters, or have him for her Husband.</hi> Judge you what an impetuous ſtorm of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion roſe in the <hi>Palatine's</hi> tempeſtuous Spirit, ſeeing himſelf contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by a ſimple Girle in two things which were extreamly ſenſible to him: The one, that <hi>Liante</hi> ſhould leave his <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Vocation (which hee had forced him to embrace) to Marry his Daughter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making him acquainted; The other, that ſhee ſhould deny a <hi>Prince,</hi> who in his Opinion did her too much Honour, and to whom hee had ingaged his Promiſe. His <hi>Fury</hi> grew to ſuch Exceſs, that Hee ſpake of nothing but dipping his Hands in her Blood, to puniſh her for a <hi>Rebellion</hi> which hee deemed worthy of no leſs than <hi>Death.</hi> And in effect if ſhee had not been withdrawn out of his Preſence, probably hee would have committed ſome notorious ſcandall. Hee curſed and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt thoſe that hindred him from tearing her in pieces, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf with Eyes caſting Flames of Rage towards <hi>Aretuza, Thus</hi> (ſayd hee) <hi>you bring up your Daughters: Go, and if you make her not change her Note, and crave pardon for her obſtinate refuſall, hope for nothing from mee but moſt-rigorous uſage, and to end your Days by ſome memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable puniſhment. Ile teach you to obey mee, or Ile make you meaſure the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51476:45"/> Ground with your extended Corps.</hi> Thus did the irritated <hi>Podolian</hi> vent his Choller, whileſt the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> without uttering one Sillable did loſe himſelf in the confuſion of his thoughts. <hi>What?</hi> ſayd hee within himſelf, <hi>Am I come ſo far to receive an Affront, to gather the Reliques of a dying</hi> Favour, <hi>and ſuffer a repulſe from a Creature that hath neither</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>nor</hi> Riches <hi>capable to attract my</hi> Love, <hi>that ſurpaſſeth mee neither in Birth nor Breeding; and must I return to ſerve for a Fable and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtock to the whole Court?</hi> Oh Mother! <hi>In what a buſineſs have have you imbarked me? Oh</hi> Ambition! <hi>upon what Rocks of ignominy dost thou preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate mee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſpicia</hi> on the other ſide was no leſs perplexed, this preſaged no good to her Pretences; for, as Shee believe That one of theſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances beeing accompliſhed, might bee a means to further the other, So, ſhee feared that the diſſolution of <hi>This,</hi> would bee the deſtruction of <hi>That</hi> which ſhee moſt deſired. At length <hi>Clemencia</hi> proved like a Leaf, that is moved with every breath of Wind. For, <hi>Aretuza</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecret of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and ſeeing into what Extremities <hi>Paſſion</hi> was likely to tranſport <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> if Shee perſevered in that Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Prayed her, Preached to her, and tormented her ſo much, that in the end ſhee tore a kind of Conſent from her, like to the ſecond <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> which drops not from the <hi>Tree</hi> but by violent Scratching and Raking with Teeth of Iron. <hi>Caſſin</hi> who would not poſſeſs the <hi>Body,</hi> when another injoyed the <hi>Heart,</hi> not to joyn (as it were) the Living with the Dead, carried himſelf with extream coldneſs in this Treaty, which hee ſigned onely out of compliance to his <hi>Mather's</hi> Will, who never ceaſed conjuring him; And <hi>Clemencia</hi> (with a thouſand Tears, witneſſes of her unwillingneſs) did the like, by the abſolute command of her imperious <hi>Father.</hi> Theſe were very diſcordant Accords, and which (if no other <hi>Tune</hi> were added) will never make any good <hi>Muſick.</hi> But that which ruined all was, when <hi>Caſſin</hi> came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his <hi>Mother's</hi> Affections to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and how ſhee managed the Accompliſhment of her own deſires under the Name of <hi>Simphoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za;</hi> For, judging how ruinous her ſecond Marriage might prove to him, according to that Maxime, which ſaith, <hi>That Shee who re-marrieth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth War againſt the Children of her firſt Bed;</hi> Hee reſolved to return to the <hi>Court,</hi> and uſe all poſſible means by his Intereſt and Credit with His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to hinder that Marriage of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and His <hi>Mother.</hi> So, leaving <hi>Mother, Mistreſs, Mieſlas</hi> and all <hi>Podolia,</hi> hee poſted away to the <hi>Court</hi> without acquainting any of them with his Departure. In
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51476:45"/> what confuſion <hi>Reſpicia</hi> remained, you may better Imagine than I De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, when ſhee ſaw her Practiſes Diſcovered, which ſhee had, till then, carried on with ſuch circumſpection. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> hereupon had a fair pretence to perſonate the <hi>Male</hi>-content, and defer thoſe Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Ceremonies untill better opportunity, alledging <hi>that</hi> during his Exile (ſo hee tearmed his Retirement from <hi>Court</hi>) hee eſteemed it not fit to Talk or Think of <hi>Marrying,</hi> no more than to wear <hi>Green</hi> for mourning; beſides, <hi>that</hi> his Enemies might take occaſion from thence to poſſeſs the <hi>King,</hi> that hee made little account of his Diſgrace, ſince, hee paſſed the time in Feaſting, Magnificence and Jollity.</p>
               <p>That which made <hi>Iphigenes</hi> fulleſt of Care and Penſiveneſs, was <hi>Liante's</hi> Impriſonment, the inlargement of whom Hee Reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by ſome Invention or other, or to periſh in the attempt. What need is there of Strength, or Stratagems? <hi>Gold</hi> doth all. There's no Place impregnable to him that ſhoot's <hi>Golden</hi> Bullets; no Caſtle ſo ſtrongly fortified, but is Acceſſible and Penetrable by a Mule loaden with that metall, as ſaid a certain <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Mecedonians.</hi> With theſe <hi>Suns</hi> of Darkneſs, hee dazled the Eyes of <hi>Liante's</hi> Keepers, and made him Eſcape away ſo handſomely, that it ſeemed to have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his own Induſtry, than through any Negligence of their's: And by the intercourſe of <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> his faithfull Foſter-Father, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand hee conveyed to him all things neceſſary for a Journey into his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> where hee gave him a ſecret <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> and followed him ſome few dayes after, leaving <hi>Aretuza</hi> full of Conſolation to ſee him ſo well educated, and yet in mervellous perplexity of Mind, knowing that ſhortly all the Myſtery, which had ſo long been concealed, would be diſcovered: But ſhee was ſomewhat eaſed by the aſſurance which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> gave her, of beeing carefull above all things to preſerve his Honour, which was no leſs Recommendable to him than his <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who formerly did ſo rail at <hi>Aretuza,</hi> now (like a Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs) had drawn all the trouble upon himſelf: For, the <hi>Prince Caſſin's</hi> going away Diſcontented; <hi>Clemencia's</hi> Paſſion for <hi>Liante,</hi> which (as ſhee witneſſed by her Sighs and Tears) was unremoveable; <hi>Liante's</hi> eſcape out of Priſon; <hi>Iphigenes's</hi> Diſpleaſure for <hi>Modeſtina's</hi> ſevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, who could no more be thruſt out, than <hi>Reſpicia</hi> or <hi>Simpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roza</hi> be received into his Heart; the <hi>Princeſſe's</hi> affliction for all theſe confuſed Imbroilments: And laſtly, the apparent Diſgrace of his <hi>Son,</hi> having loſt the <hi>King's</hi> Favour and Preſence; All theſe hapning upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51476:46"/> the Neck of one another, put his Wiſdom to ſeek a Determination. After long Raving, and not finding any Thred to draw him out of this <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> Hee reſolved to return with the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia</hi> to <hi>Court,</hi> to ſee how his <hi>Son's</hi> buſineſs ſtood there, and to hinder <hi>Calumnie</hi> from prevailing ſo much againſt his <hi>Innocency,</hi> as to cauſe the time of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation to be lengthened, knowing well that thoſe Regions which are moſt remote from the <hi>Sun</hi> are both Cold and Barren, and that by the long continuance of Froſt, the Ice turn's into Chryſtall, which the Rayes of the <hi>Prince</hi> of the Stars are not able to diſſolve. <hi>Kings</hi> are commonly like Nurſes, who care for their Foſter-Children no longer than they are hanging at their Breſts; For they cheriſh their <hi>Favorites,</hi> but while they are in their Sight: Abſence with its inſenſible Spunge effaceth them by little and little out of their Memories.</p>
               <p>It is ſo ordinary a thing for Children to complain, when their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fly to a ſecond <hi>Hymen,</hi> that it is no wonder if <hi>Reſpicia</hi> at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn found all the <hi>Court</hi> poſſeſſed with the news of her new Flames, which by her uſuall ſubtilities ſhee indeavoured to ſmother: And to ſtop the Current of that Opinion, ſhee ſayd, <hi>That the putting of her ſelf in her Daughter's place, was onely to amuſe</hi> Iphigenes, <hi>and to gain the time which was neceſſary for the annulling of his Marriage with</hi> Modeſtina, <hi>and that having him ſure by an Agreement, it would be eaſie for her,</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoroza <hi>beeing grown to a competent Age, to remit her in her place to accompliſh the Contract with</hi> Iphigenes, <hi>blaming her Son for taking with the Left-hand her Right intentions.</hi> This Excuſe ſhee covered with ſo much Art (as ſhee plaſtered her Face with Painting) that as <hi>this</hi> made her ſeem Beautifull though ſhee was not, ſo <hi>that</hi> gave her Speech an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſhew of Truth, though in effect it was clean contrary. That in private ſhee rebuked with vehemency the <hi>Prince,</hi> her Son, <hi>threatning to deprive him of the Succeſſion of her Eſtate, for having indeavoured to caſt dirt in his Mother's Face,</hi> I make no difficulty to believe: for, ſuch vain and haughty Spirits, as her's, ſuffer not without reſentment the leaſt Affronts or Obloquies. And Hee, who deſired no better than the publick Declaration which ſhee made, of not pretending to break her Widdow-hood, made her all the Satisfactions his filiall obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could ſuggeſt, which ſhee included all in this one Condition, <hi>That hee ſhould not diſclaim the Agreement made with</hi> Clemencia; For, holding him faſt tied with the Band of that Alliance, it would be more eaſie for her (ſhee conceived) to recover the Track of her former Chaſe. As for <hi>Mieſlas</hi> hee was received into the ſame Rank hee had before
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51476:46"/> in the <hi>King</hi>'s Council, and his <hi>Majeſtice</hi> communicated his deſigns more particularly to him, to the end hee might underſtand thereby, that the diſmiſſing of his Son <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was not any Diſgrace, but a Remedy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſſipate the clouds which <hi>Detraction</hi> had ſuſcitated betwixt <hi>Him</hi> and the <hi>Queen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Courtier</hi> Inured to the tricks and Policies practiſed in <hi>King</hi>'s Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hath incomparable Induſtries and wayes to pick open the Secrets of the Mind's Cabinet. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> did ſo much by his Inqueſts &amp; cloſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he diſcovered the <hi>Match,</hi> and by the <hi>Train</hi> found out the whole <hi>Mine.</hi> It being an ordinary thing amongſt Traitors to appeach one another, ſome of the malicious <hi>Cabal</hi> of <hi>Calumniators,</hi> thinking to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate with <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> (whoſe credit in <hi>Court</hi> they ſaw was nothing diminiſhed by his abſence) revealed to <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> to the prejudice of their Companions, the whole Impoſture concerning his Son, and what Stratagem they had uſed to work him out of the <hi>King</hi>'s favour. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſlas</hi> having heard all the paſſages from point to point, evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by the ſeverall diſcoureſes which hee had obſerved to fall now and then by piece-meal as well from the <hi>Queen</hi>'s mouth as the <hi>King</hi>'s, that his Informers did not amuſe him with fopperies, but touched the matter home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in mean time arrived in his <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Vratislaü,</hi> with a Train and Equipage little Inferiour to the <hi>King</hi>'s, not unlike to thoſe vaſt <hi>Rivers</hi> which overflowing their banks carry away all they meet in their <hi>Courſe</hi> through the Vallies, or thoſe Maſſie pieces of <hi>Rock</hi> which falling from the ridge of a Steep Mountain, tumble before and draw after them a multitude of other ſmall Stones. A great number of the Gentry of <hi>Podolia,</hi> conducted him to the Confines of <hi>Vratislaü,</hi> where hee was received by the <hi>Lords-Caſtellains</hi> and Gentlemen of his own Government, with ſuch applauſe and joy, that it was plainly to been ſeen his <hi>Favour</hi> was not Extinguiſhed neither in the opinion of the Nobles nor Comon-People. The <hi>King</hi> had by expreſs letters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Towns in his <hi>Palatinate</hi> to render him the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as to his Royall perſon, promiſing to acknowledg and gratifie thoſe that reſpected him, whom Hee eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Among all the Noble-men and perſons of note about <hi>Iphigenes, Pomeran, Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides</hi> appeared like great <hi>Planets</hi> among the ſmaller <hi>Stars,</hi> which in a Serene Night are ſeen twinkling in the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>Courteſie</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> (which poliſh the Spirits of <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and make a Viſible diſtinction betwixt them and the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51476:47"/> 
                  <hi>Country</hi> Gentry) were held in ſuch recommendation by thoſe Gallants, that in ſtead of Slighting or Scoffing at thoſe who were ſo much their Inferiours, they treated them with ſuch endearing Affability, that they made a Conqueſt of Hearts for the <hi>Palatine,</hi> ſo conſiderable, that within very ſhort time hee had a moſt abſolute power in his <hi>Province.</hi> In a ſelect place whereof <hi>Liante</hi> having made his retreat, expecting an opportunity to confer with <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> judged it his ſecureſt way to avoid all ſort of ſuſpition, to diſguiſe himſelf in the habit of a <hi>Country</hi> Wench: of which deſign hee advertiſed the <hi>Palatine</hi> by Letters, who applauded much the Invention.</p>
               <p>LIANTE having left all thoſe of his attendance in a neighbouring Town, retired himſelf to a Country Farmer'<hi>s</hi> Houſe in a little Village within the Forreſt, (having firſt dazled the Clown's eyes with that Metall, whoſe Power dimmeth the cleareſt ſights, and makes tongues Silent, or ſpeak what the giver liſteth) where hee took the charge of his Cattle in quality of a <hi>Shepherdeſs.</hi> And <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (after hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt Honours of his Charge, and that by ſeverall Magnificent Banquets, Balls, Turnaments, and other publique rejoycings, thoſe of that Province had expreſſed the contentment which they received in ſeeing themſelves ſubjected to ſo ſweet a Government as his) for his ordinary divertiſement made choice of the pleaſure of Hunting, which is generally affected by great perſons, becauſe in Peace it make's them ſee ſome ſhadow of their profeſſion of Warre, and entertain's their high Spirits with more Generoſity than any other recreation: The <hi>Towns</hi> ſeemed <hi>Priſons</hi> to him, the <hi>Fields</hi> and <hi>Woods</hi> a <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> For, being deprived at one time of both thoſe <hi>Luminaries,</hi> which enlightned his thoughts, <hi>Love</hi> and the <hi>Court;</hi> I mean, the two Objects of his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Liante,</hi> Hee became like a <hi>Flower</hi> without the <hi>Dew,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> without <hi>Water;</hi> Inſomuch that it might eaſily bee gathered by the alteration of his Complexion, that there was no ſmall diſturbance in his Mind. And to confeſs the truth, if either of thoſe Paſſions alone bee ſufficient to trouble the firmeſt brain, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs will they cauſe being joyned together? The pain which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed's from the deſire of <hi>Glory,</hi> and of poſſeſſing the moſt eminent <hi>Dignities,</hi> is a great Torment to a generous <hi>Soul;</hi> And if you add the Intereſt of <hi>Riches,</hi> which are as the Bones and Sinews to ſuſtein that Greatneſs, you will render the ſorrow for the privation of theſe two things very vehement: But amongſt people of no mean Judgments, the grief which the abſence of a beloved Object doth ingender in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51476:47"/> minde, is eſteemed the leaſt ſupportable. You may imagine then in what a Tempeſt was <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Spirit agitated, having before his eyes neither of thoſe favourable <hi>Stars,</hi> which only could procure his Calm, the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> of his <hi>Prince,</hi> nor the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of <hi>Liante, Liante</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Affection,</hi> nor the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> of his <hi>Ambition.</hi> But where <hi>Love</hi> preſides, all other Paſſions muſt give place: The loſs of <hi>Iphigenes</hi>'s hopes in <hi>Court</hi> was leſs ſenſible to him in the obſcurity of this Exile, injoying <hi>Liante</hi>'s preſence, than the want of his beloved ſight was in the midſt of all his Honours and Delights at the height of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BOLESLAUS, the faithfull Depoſitary of all his Secrets, who was not Ignorant of the juſt pretenſions hee had for <hi>Liante,</hi> (wherein as in all other occurrences, ayming at nothing but his contentment, hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to ſerve him) by his frequent comming and going to the <hi>Hamlet,</hi> where <hi>Liante</hi> (under the name of ALMERIA) kept himſelf concealed, prepared an Interview for theſe two dear friends. By whoſe directions <hi>Iphigenes</hi> went ſo many times a hunting that way, that at length in deſpight of all his followers (who never loſt ſight of him) hee happily loſt himſelf to find out the <hi>Canton,</hi> where his <hi>Shepherdeſs</hi> fed her gentle Flock. Let all thoſe, who are not Ignorant of the Effects of a ſincere Friendſhip, bee Judges of the reſentments of thoſe two Souls at this meeting, ſo Long expected, ſo Ardently deſired, and effected no leſs Succesfully than contrived with Dexterity. For, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late you here all their indearing ſpeeches in entertaining each other, would be perhaps to ſay much to little purpoſe, and fill theſe Pages, which are not deſtined (as not deſired) for any other end, than to repreſent the Event of their Adventures. Only in two words I may ſay, that their Minds diſcharged themſelves in each other's Boſome of that weighty Burthen of Thoughts, which they had been breeding ever ſince their Separation. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> firſt giving <hi>Liante</hi> an account of the divers Traverſes, that <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſometimes Kinde, ſometimes Cruell, had made him Undergoe at <hi>Court,</hi> which is the Theater, whereon, to the View of the whole World, ſhee doth expoſe her moſt Extravagant actions. There hee diſplayed the ſeverall ſucceſſes of the <hi>King</hi>'s Favour; the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Courteſie; the <hi>Envie</hi> of the <hi>Grandees;</hi> the <hi>Calumnie</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne Spirits; the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the <hi>Ladies;</hi> the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and his being Baniſhed; his Incounter with <hi>Scaniſlas,</hi> whoſe <hi>Palatinate</hi> hee injoyed, having taken his life; the ſubtle deportments of the <hi>Princeſs Respicia;</hi> his being diſmis't from <hi>Court,</hi> by a Plot which had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51476:48"/> to him by <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ſince his arrivall at <hi>Vratiſlaü;</hi> In ſumm, hee gave him an abridgment of every paſſage mentioned in this <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with divers other particulars which were too tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe.</p>
               <p>LIANTE reciprocally acquainted him with the miſery and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents which he had received by his abſence, the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> whereof he was in hopes ſomewhat to mitigate by the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of the affections, which hee had caſt into his Soul for the amiable <hi>Clemencia,</hi> whoſe Goodneſs, Conſtancy, and fervent <hi>Love</hi> hee felt himſelf obliged to cheriſh, beſides the paſſionate Ambition hee had of having a double relation to him, by the <hi>alliance</hi> of his Siſter <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (for whoſe ſake hee highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded his withſtanding ſo may aſſaults) and by <hi>that</hi> which hee deſired to Contract with <hi>Clemencia;</hi> wherereunto, if hee were not incited by that Glory, Hee ſhould however eſteem himſelf ingaged (unleſs hee would incur the Repute of the moſt Ingratefull amongſt Men) for the firme Reſiſtance which ſhee had made, notwithſtanding all the Rigours of her ſevere Father, ſhewing the Excellency of her Courage, in that (to maintein the Faith which ſhee had ſo many times ſworn to him) ſhee did refuſe a <hi>Prince,</hi> who in Birth, Quality, and Eſtate, was far more conſiderable than hee, to whom the violent uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had left nothing but <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Portion, Hope. From this <hi>Paſſion</hi> which hee expreſſed for <hi>Iphigenes</hi>'s Siſter, and which ſerved as a Charm in his Melancholic reſtraints, Hee fell to the <hi>Treaſon</hi> of <hi>Perpetua</hi> and his Governour, (ſo hee tearmed the diſcovery of his Letters, under whoſe Aſhes they diſcloſed his Fire;) thence to the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> where the Cruelty of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had kept him ſo cloſe Priſoner, and from which hee owed his releaſement to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> whom hee ſtyled his <hi>Deliverer,</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> the <hi>Star</hi> of his <hi>Hope,</hi> with as many other ſweet Appellations as an Intire Friendſhip could ſuggeſt, which made his Friend clearly ſee the Profound Reſentments of his Soul for this laſt Obligation, which was the greater, in regard Liberty is ſweeter than Life.</p>
               <p>Whereunto <hi>Iphigenes</hi> replyed, That <hi>that was but the dore of the building of that great</hi> Fortune, <hi>whereunto Hee intended to raiſe him, if letting lye dormant for a while his Pretenſions to</hi> Clemencia <hi>(wherein hee ſaw ſo many oppoſitions) hee would give eare to his Counſells, by which hee would render him the greateſt man in</hi> Polonia. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſaid this, becauſe, as ordinarily wee are apteſt to put our hands upon the place that paine's us moſt, the ſtrong Inclination which <hi>Liante</hi> revealed for <hi>Clemencia,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51476:48"/> bred a jealous Apprehenſion in his Breſt, leſt his Heart being prepoſſeſſed, could not admit of his Affection in that juſt manner hee deſired, and you may eaſily Conjecture. As a great Light doth dimm a leſs, and (according to the Proverb) one Naile drives out another: So it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeen that two Violent Paſſions do reign together in one Heart, the Bed is two narrow to receive them both. Where <hi>Love</hi> hath the Empire, <hi>Vanity</hi> muſt yeild: For that Quality which cauſeth <hi>Love,</hi> hath little <hi>Ambition.</hi> But where that aſpiring <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>Honours</hi> hath the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant, Love</hi> muſt deliver his Arms. And whatſoever the Fable telleth us of the Aſſociation of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> it is hard to finde them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Vulcan</hi> did, without rendring them ridiculous; Theſe <hi>Planets</hi> in their Aſpects have never any favourable Conjunction; for, how can one joyne two things ſo directly contrary, as the Exerciſes of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace?</hi> The Judgement of <hi>Paris</hi> doth ſufficiently demonſtrate, that the Apple could not bee divided, but that either <hi>Glory</hi> (which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi>) muſt give place to <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> or that <hi>Delights</hi> muſt yeild to the <hi>Deſire</hi> of <hi>Honours:</hi> For, as there is no entrance into the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi> but by the dore of <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſo there is no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Temple of <hi>Vertue,</hi> but through the Porch of <hi>Labour.</hi> This I ſay, becauſe <hi>Liante,</hi> who was more <hi>Ambitious</hi> than <hi>Amorous</hi> (quite contrary to <hi>Iphigenes</hi>) catched with both hands at his Brother's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, promiſing him not to think of <hi>Clemencia</hi> any father than his Commandements or Permiſſion ſhould allow, remitting his <hi>Fortune</hi> ſolely to his Conduct, and eſteeming it a great happineſs to attend on him in quality of a Servant, and depend abſolutely upon his Will. O <hi>Iphigenes</hi> how ſweetly did theſe laſt words flatter thy Imagination, ſince this Shaft hit ſo directly the <hi>Blank</hi> of all thy thoughts?</p>
               <p>As <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had even upon the Brink of his Lips the diſcovery of his Project to advance <hi>Liante</hi> in the World, (which was the point that tickled moſt his generous Heart, therein not unlike <hi>Virgins,</hi> whoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall Temptations are the more preſſing, becauſe they fancy the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall pleaſures to be far greater than they are:) <hi>Fortune,</hi> like the Sea which never keep's its face long Calm, thwarted the impatient deſire of our diſguiſed <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> to make her know <hi>that</hi> in this tranſitory dwelling wee have nothing perfect, <hi>that</hi> the faireſt dayes are followed by Nights, the ſweeteſt flowers environed with Thorns, and no Hony to be gotten without ſome Stinging. For, as he had aſſembled all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Soul in his Ears, to hear what his Brother had deſigned for his Promotion, the winding of the <hi>Hunter's</hi> Horns, making the Foreſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51476:49"/> reſound with a thouſand <hi>Ecchoes,</hi> gave them notice that the Game was not far off. So that, not to bee ſurpriſed together, they were inforced to part not without promiſing to meet again with the firſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie. The Hunts-men, who were more in pain for the ſtraying of their <hi>Maſter,</hi> than their miſſing of the <hi>Stag,</hi> whoſe Strain they could not finde, all their Hounds being at a loſs, ſeemed to ask news with their <hi>Horns</hi> and <hi>Hollowes</hi> of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> who ruſhing through the thickets to the place of the noyſe, found his Men, but no Game; With whom hee returned as much contented that hee had ſeen <hi>Liante,</hi> as little ſatisfied for having diſcovered that hee reteined yet ſo much Paſſion for his Siſter <hi>Clemencia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader perchance will think ſtrange why theſe Brothers ſhould uſe ſuch Circumſpection in their Interviews, in regard <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as well as other <hi>Palatines,</hi> being very powerfull, and in a manner Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign in his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> might have made <hi>Liante</hi> of his Train, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him in his own Pallace. But what ſafegard or Protection can ſhelter a man from Traitors, and ſecure him from the hands of thoſe who Perſecute him by waies the more dangerous, becauſe leaſt known? you are then to take notice, <hi>that</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Liante</hi> had made his eſcape out of Priſon by means of his dear Brother-in-law, <hi>Mieſtas</hi> (whoſe Rigour and Cruelty paſſed the quality of a <hi>Sarmatian,</hi> and who from the beginning did expreſs an unheard-of malice againſt this Innocent Youth) gave Commiſſion to ſeverall murtherous Villains, who bound themſelves by Execrable Oaths to bring him back to Priſon, or if they could not take him alive, to bring him his head, and in caſe they could not accompliſh this by force, <hi>that</hi> they would make uſe of <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Poiſon.</hi> In this Barbariſme the Salvage <hi>Podolian</hi> had two ends; One, to hinder <hi>Liante</hi> from pretending to his Daughter, and that being out of the World his conſideration ſhould be no hinderance to her Alliance with <hi>Caſſin,</hi> which hee exceedingly deſired: The other, to gain his whole Inheritance to himſelf, by muing up in a Monaſtery with his other Daughters the unfortunate <hi>Modeſtina. Iphigenes</hi> having got an inkling of this accurſed Conſpiracy, gave notice thereof to <hi>Liante,</hi> which obliged him to conceale and Diſguiſe himſelf, as is ſaid. For if hee had been known, how could hee have ſecured himſelf from the Ambuſhes of Murtherers, who founding their Fortunes upon his Death, would alwaies have been Levelling at him, and held him in continuall fear? Was not this apprehenſion, together with the difficulty hee had to accoſt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (who was his only Solace and Refuge) enough to afflict
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51476:49"/> this young Spirit, but the Fates muſt perſecute him with further Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, and aſſail him with unſavory Ruſtick importunities in his Diſguiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Country-man,</hi> in whoſe Houſe hee had retired himſelf, beeing a Widdower, committed the managing of all his Husbandry and Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold to the charge of a Son, yet unmarried, and two Daughters ready to be Married; the Elder whereof (named <hi>Merinda</hi>) hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined to acquaint with the ſecret of <hi>Liante,</hi> telling her <hi>that</hi> hee was a young Man, who having committed a Murther, was fled for ſhelter in his Cottage, and <hi>that</hi> to avoid the hands of Juſtice, hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to diſguiſe himſelf: therefore hee willed her to help him to a Country Wenche's habit, and hee would entertain him to keep his Cattell in nature of a Shepherdeſs; Injoyning her to bee ſilent under pain of his Diſpleaſure, and making her underſtand beſides, the great profit they ſhould gain thereby, hee being a Rich Man's Son, and who might bee very beneficiall to them. <hi>Merinda</hi> put this <hi>Coal</hi> into her boſom, I ſhould ſay, this <hi>ſecret;</hi> but it is all one for a Maid to hold the one or the other: yet I ſpake in ſome kind more properly than I was aware. For, Judge you, if it was not to put a <hi>Coal</hi> (and of the hotteſt too) in the boſom of a luſty Laſs, the giving her a handſome young Man for a conſtant Companion. In ſumme, the Face of the feined <hi>Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> inſenſibly made impreſſion in <hi>Merinda's</hi> Heart, which put her in the like Condition as thoſe that are ſtung with a certain venimous Creature, known in <hi>Italy</hi> by the Name of TARANTOLA, whoſe pricking, becauſe not to bee perceived upon the skin, the affected place is never diſcovered by any ſwelling, untill the venim hath poſſeſſ't the Heart and become remedileſs; <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> are the two Wings of <hi>Love,</hi> which beating the Wind make the flame kindle. <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> was all on fire, and reduce almoſt to Aſhes, before her little wit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Burning.</p>
               <p>Fire is hard to take in great pieces of Wood; but if it bee once light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not eaſily quenched. This Element is ſo active, that in Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate's and melt's the hardeſt Mettalls, it calcine's Stones, no ſubſtance is able to reſiſt its vivacity: But that which cauſeth <hi>Love,</hi> is yet far more ſubtile. For it is ſo generally ſpred through the whole Univerſe, that the Antient <hi>Philoſophers</hi> eſteemed it the <hi>Soule</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Poets</hi> did Marry <hi>Olympus</hi> with <hi>Rhea,</hi> intimating that it was the Ligature of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> It burn's the <hi>Fiſhes</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Waters,</hi> the <hi>Birds</hi> cannot avoid it in the <hi>Aire,</hi> and much leſs the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51476:50"/> that are more Terreſtiall. Flints have ſecret ſparkles in their hard Bodies, and if Mankinde were repaired by them, according to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Invention of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> yet ſhould they be ſenſible of the Motions and Heat of <hi>Love.</hi> What wonder then if <hi>Merinda,</hi> who was not compoſed of Marble, did feel the Effects of this all-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Fire, beeing taken with the Graces of the amiable <hi>Liante?</hi> I will not ſtand to deſcribe the Symptomes, whereby his quick-ſighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs read her Diſeaſe; but if Shee was forbidden to communicate to any other the Diſguiſement of <hi>Almeria,</hi> without Diſguiſement Shee manifeſted her own Paſſion to him with as few Words as much Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, telling him <hi>that ſhee loved him.</hi> I might give the Reader ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation here, if I would extend my ſelf in her Homely and Naturall Expreſſions; For, as her Face (beeing no leſs expoſed to the inclemency of the Air than the Shephard's Tabernacles, or the Skins of <hi>Salomon</hi>) was without Painting; So her Diſcourſe was without any Artificiall Contexture.</p>
               <p>What pleaſure, do you imagine, was this to <hi>Almeria</hi> (thus wee muſt call <hi>Liante</hi> as long as hee ſhall continue in his Sheperdeſſe's Weeds) to ſee her ſelf Courted in this manner by her whom ſhee called Couſin? (for <hi>Celian, Merinda's</hi> Father, commanded his Daughters to uſe that tearm to her, ſaying hee was her Uncle, as <hi>Liante</hi> had deſired him.) This pleaſant humour contributed not a little to the diverting of the Melancholly, which otherwiſe would have overwhelmed his Heart in that ſolitary Reſidence, eſpecially beeing in a Condition, which was as ſtrange as difficult to him, to perſonate a Sex whereof he never had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Deportments. However the Caſſack, which hee had been forced to wear, made him the ſooner acquainted with the long Coates, and the Modeſty which had been taught him afforded ſome Decency to his Transformation. <hi>Almeria</hi> thinking onely to make a paſtime of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda's</hi> abſurd Paſſion, peſtred her ſelf in the greateſt intricacy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; for, as there is no great difference betwixt <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> nor far from <hi>Fury</hi> to <hi>Deſpair,</hi> that little Spark was enough to cauſe a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Flame. For, ſuffering the innocent Wench to intangle her ſelf in her Nets, and feining to hearken to her Reaſons, imbarked her ſo deep in the purſuit, that ſhee could not live without the converſation of this new Couſin. And as the Fire doth refine Iron untill it becometh Steel, ſo <hi>Love</hi> ſharpning the Wits of thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth, gives them more Penetrating Reaſons, then are obſerved to proceed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from cold and raw Judgements. Which if you will have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51476:50"/> by Example, heare what <hi>Merinda</hi> ſayd one day to <hi>Almeria,</hi> as they were ſitting alone under rhe ſhade of a great Elm-tree, whileſt their Sheep were feeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Although I am a Woman, do not you think</hi> good Sir, <hi>that I can keep a ſecret no more then a Sive hold Water, for I would rather indure my Soul to bee torne out of my Body, than ſuffer that to come out of my Mouth, which my Father hath committed to my Silence. You may aſſure your ſelf, that never any diſaſter ſhall befall you through fault of my fidelity, I would rather imbrace death a thouſand times, than harbour ſo unworthy a thought. And to let you ſee, for all I am but a Country-Girl, that my Soul is ſeated in a good place (and indeed it is well-ſeated, ſince it is wholly fixed to your Perfections) I pray hear what project is come into my Fancy, and which I will freely put in Execution, if you are ſo contented. You can pretend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in the World, ſince, having killed a Man of greater quality than your ſelf (as my Father hath informed mee) it is to bee ſuppoſed that all your Eſtate is confiſcate, all your Hopes loſt, and that the</hi> Juſtice, <hi>which is ſo rigorous in this Country, hath not pardoned your Memory, but hath done ſome publick ignominy to your Effigies, not beeing able to light upon your</hi> Body <hi>to puniſh it according to the Laws. Therefore as you have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your ſelf with my Cleaths to ſecure your Perſon, give leave to the Paſſion which I ſuffer for you, that I may make uſe of yours (which I have carefully lock't up) to venter my Life by going to take down that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Picture, which without doubt ſerving as a ſpectale to all Paſſingers, tarniſheth the luſter of your Reputation and diſhonoreth your Glory. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you did not commit that Homicide treacherouſly, but that it was in your own Defence, or in running half the Danger; the Deportments which I have remarked ſince I frequent your Company, give mee a ſtrong confidence that you have too much Gallantry in your mind, to do an Act unbeſeeming a Man of Honour. If I ſhould be ſurpriſed in this Exploit, which will offend the</hi> Juſtice (<hi>the torments, that I ſhall indure beeing a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my Affection to you) I ſhall expire contented: for, not beeing worthy enough to live to, and with you I ſhall be glad to die for you, and make you ſee by my conſtancy that in a ruſtick Body there is ſome ſpark of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.</hi>

                  <hi>Hippocrene,</hi> the true top of <hi>Parnaſſus, that</hi> the Extaſies of this Paſſion are as many <hi>Enthuſiaſmes</hi> which raiſe the Soul above it ſelf; and <hi>that</hi> as a Squib flieth from the Earth into the Sky, aſſoon as the Fire is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to its Train, So the clowniſheſt Bodies do become gentile, and the dulleſt Spirits ſubtilized, when once they are touched with this fire? Can you imagine a more Naturall and a more generous manner of diſcovering an ardent Affection, or of demonſtrating at the ſame time that one loveth not verbally, but in effect, and the moſt ſignalized of Effects (which is to expoſe one's Life for the party Beloved) than that which <hi>Merinda</hi> uſed to manifeſt to <hi>Almeria,</hi> the Fire, which ſhee had ſome time kept hidden under the Aſhes of Diſcretion? Indeed there are ſome Productions of <hi>Nature</hi> ſo admirable, which all the Art in the World can never reach with imitation. At <hi>Court</hi> they talk of nothing but <hi>Deſpair,</hi> poure our ſuch deep Proteſtations, as make the Hearers tremble, and <hi>Death,</hi> whom one of the Antients called the <hi>Diety</hi> of <hi>Lovers,</hi> is invoked every Moment; There it is ordinary to threaten to caſt themſelves away; to thruſt their Souls out of their Bodies at a Sword's Point; they exclaim againſt Rigours; call <hi>Honour Cruelty,</hi> and the Impatience of Deſires an inſupportable Torment; their Tears are feined, their Tearms Specious; But all that is but vain babbling, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lips, not of the Heart, an idle Reſignment, no reall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; They ſay enough, but ſee who perform's: <hi>Fidelity</hi> is onely in their words, <hi>Infidelity</hi> in their Actions; <hi>Loyalty</hi> in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Treaſon</hi> in the Execution; <hi>Purity</hi> in their Tongues, and baſe <hi>Deſigns</hi> in their thoughts; In ſumme, <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Duplicity</hi> are the Paſtimes of <hi>Courtiers,</hi> but their end is the ruin of <hi>Hearts,</hi> and the Poyſon of <hi>Souls.</hi> Amongſt Country People it is clean otherwiſe, their Cloaths, Diet, Lodgings, Induſtries, all are plain and ſimple, So are their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and their meanings; what they have upon their Lips come's from the profoundeſt of their thoughts, not belying by their proceedings the Union which <hi>Nature</hi> hath made of the Root of the Tongue with the Heart. So that <hi>Almeria</hi> eaſily perceiving the reality of <hi>Merinda's</hi> Paſſion, and being moved with Compaſſion to ſee that Shee fruitleſly aymed at an Object beyond her Port, and that her Deſires were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported more by the Wings of <hi>Love,</hi> than of <hi>Ambition,</hi> thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to eſteem her Courage, and repay her Affection with this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dear</hi> Merinda, <hi>I fear I ſhall never bee able to do any thing for you, that can countervail the Obligations I have to you already, without adding this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51476:51"/> incomparable Teſtimony of your Affection, offering to expoſe your Life for the defence of the Shadow of my Honour. It would bee too ſenſible a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to mee, that you ſhould employ your Body for a</hi> Fantome, <hi>for ſo I call the Execution of an</hi> Image, <hi>or rather imaginary Revenge, which the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of</hi> Juſtice <hi>may exerciſe againſt mee in my abſence: as for my true Honour, it is out of all danger, in regard it was rather to defend than offend, that I did kill my Enemy: But his Kindred are ſo powerfull, that they will weigh down the Scale of</hi> Juſtice, <hi>and reduce mee to the greateſt extremity, that diſasters can compell an unfortunate Man to undergoe. Therefore I pretend to nothing now in my Country, nor to my Eſtate, but ſhall think my ſelf happy enough if with preſervation of my Life, I can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my Perſon from thoſe ignominious Torments, which my Adverſaries would make mee ſuffer, if I fell into their Hands, who ſeek to glut their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull Spirits with my Blood. This is the Reaſon which made mee have recourſe to the Fidelity of your Father and you, not contenting my ſelf to embrace a Condition ſo much below that, unto which by the Favour of Heaven I have hitherto been educated, but by changing my Habit to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf under this Diſguiſe leſs Subject to the ſtrokes of Fortune. As for the ſervice you propoſed to do mee in tearing down my Effigies from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous place, I believe that indeavour will bee needleſs, for my own Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred intereſſed by that diſhonour to their Family, have doubtleſs e're this uſed means to take away that diſgracefull Remembrance. But wherefore do I call it diſgracefull, ſince the Infamy is in the Fact, not in the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? So that not feeling any remorſe in my Soul for</hi> that, <hi>I ought not to eſteem</hi> this <hi>any Diſparagement; quite contrary when I recall to my memory with what valour I prevented the Aſſaſſinate which was intended to my Perſon, and how I behaved my ſelf in the Combat, the Gibet whereon they have hung mee in</hi> Effigies, <hi>Seemeth to mee as an</hi> Obelisk <hi>or</hi> Pyramide <hi>erected to the Glory of my Vertue. Nevertheleſs I cannot but acknowledge a ſingular Obligation to you, for that worthy Office which your Friendſhip perſwaded you to render mee, and I will indeavour by all poſſible devoirs to aſcertain you, that Ingratitude hath no harbour within my Breſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Merinda,</hi> who was not ſo well acquainted with the Art of placing her words, but who had very reall Reſentments of Affection for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> replied after her manner, <hi>That what ſhee had propoſed, was to let him ſee by the little eſteem ſhee made of her Life, that thence forwards ſhee never would imploy it, but to Honour and Love him, to the end, that, if her mean Birth did render her unworthy of poſſeſſing his Favours, her Humility and perfect Submiſſion might ſupply the place of Deſert.</hi> But
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51476:52"/> why do I ſtand to diſguiſe the Language of a ſimple Shepherdeſs, in whoſe Mouth polite words would ſute as ill as Painting upon her Cheeks? I might have onely ſaid, That <hi>Shee freely diſcloſed the Deſign ſhee had to Marry him, if he pleaſed, and follow him to the World's end, imagining, as the Helmet of a Valiant Warrier is ſometimes changed into a Bee-Hive, and Chambers that have been hung with the coſtlieſt Tapiſtries, become Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes for Spiders, the beautiful Adoleſcent, diſguſted with the trouble in Cities and glutted with the Grandeurs of the World, (like that Antient</hi> Emperour, <hi>who reſigned his Scepter for a</hi> Gardner's <hi>Spade) would perchance bee glad to reduce himſelf to a Paſtorall Life, and endure ſome hardſhip after his ſweet Delights.</hi> But <hi>Almeria</hi> was far from any ſuch thought, her <hi>Ambition</hi> which aymed at nothing but Governing <hi>Provinces,</hi> &amp; commanding <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> could not deſcend to follow ſilly Sheep.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut as there is a certain imperious Inclination predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant generally in our Souls, which maketh us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably affect to render our ſelves amiable, and bee admired as well as beloved, without regarding by whom; this ſauce beeing ſo delightfull, that it make's all Meats go down: Inſomuch that wee feel a complacency and contentment to ſee our ſelves followed and fawned
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51476:53"/> on by brute Beaſts, as Sheep, Dogs, Cats, Birds, Fiſhes (witneſs the <hi>Murena</hi> of <hi>Craſſus</hi>) and although they have neither beauty nor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, their applying of themſelves to us doth gain inſenſibly our Affections, and maketh us cheriſh them: <hi>Almeria</hi> to divert the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly of that uncouth Life, and to recreate her fancy with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Merinda's</hi> pain, took an humour to ingage her further in that Paſſion, by opening her the Gate of <hi>Hope</hi> with ſuch quaint and cunningly framed Tearms, as (like Arrowes dipped in Oyl) they preſently pierced through her Simple Heart. <hi>Merinda,</hi> like the generality of Country People, took <hi>Almeria's</hi> Words of Compliment and Civility for reall Obligations, and thoſe Sparks grew to ſuch a Blaze in her Breſt, that it ſeemed as if nothing but the Aſhes of the Grave could quench it, whileſt the feined Shepherdeſs hugged her ſelf with delight to ſee her ſo intrapped in her Snares; a pleaſure, I muſt confeſs, very malicious, but marvellouſly delicious.</p>
               <p>But Shee was not the onely prey that fell into the Nets of the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Almeria,</hi> rather ſhee ſerved as a <hi>Decoy</hi> to draw other ſilly Birds unto the <hi>Tunnell.</hi> For, as the <hi>Sun</hi> at his riſing upon our <hi>Horizon,</hi> doth fill all places (where hee ſhewe's his Head) with the glory of his light and heat; So <hi>Almeria</hi> had no ſooner illuſtrated that ſolitude with her Preſence, but all Eyes (capable of conſidering her Worth) were fixed on her Face, as if it had been a <hi>Load-stone,</hi> or a piece of <hi>Amber</hi> for thoſe Hearts, which may bee ſaid to bee of <hi>Iron</hi> for their rude unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhedneſs, and of <hi>Straw</hi> for their ſimplicity. <hi>Merinda</hi> had a Brother, named <hi>Manile,</hi> who lived in the ſame Houſe, and had the overſeeing of his Father's Husbandry; This Brother having divers times ſeriouſly contemplated the not ordinary complexion of <hi>Almeria,</hi> was raviſhed as with the aſpect of an <hi>Angell:</hi> and from this over-curious Sight proceeded the loſs of his Liberty. Hee was certain that this lovely Stranger was no Neece of his Father's, and beſides hee perceived by her garb that ſhee was born to ſome better imployment than following of Sheep; in a word, this imaginary <hi>Servant</hi> became the reall <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs</hi> of his Inclinations. One day, Hee inquired very earneſtly, who that Maid was, of his Father <hi>Celian,</hi> who beeing unwilling to diſcover the Myſtery of <hi>Almeria's</hi> Transfiguration, payed his curioſity with a Tale which hee invented on the ſodain, making him believe that ſhee was a Gentlewoman of a Citty not far thence, who beeing fallen into ſome fault of Frailty, was fled thither to avoid her Friend's Fury, and that (the better to keep her ſelf concealed) ſhee had tranſveſted her
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51476:53"/> ſelf like a Shepherdeſs, notwithſtanding ſhee was deſcended of an Honourable extraction. This caſt <hi>Oyl</hi> in abundance into the <hi>Fire</hi> that was kindled in <hi>Manile</hi>'s breſt; for, this Imagination preſently mounted to his brain; <hi>If Almeria were a light Huſwife, hee ſhould eaſily Induce her to ſatisfie his deſires; if otherwiſe, however ſhee might bee perſwaded to bee his Wife, not caring though hee wedded a Diſgrace, ſo hee might cure his Love.</hi> Thereupon hee forged theſe Reaſons, apparently charitable; <hi>that</hi> taking her to Wife hee ſhould withdraw her from Lewdneſs, Save her from the Shipwrack of her evident ruine, Protect her from the Fury of her Irritated Parents, Repair her Honour by that Sacrament, fancying to himſelf that Honour conſiſting in nothing but Opinion, ſhee would rather condeſcend to take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in his Arms, and live with the Repute of an honeſt Woman in a Country Village, where her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance was not known, than in the Citty where ſhee would be ſcorned and upbraided by every body, and where (what pennance ſoever a poor Maid doth after ſuch a ſcape) the <hi>World,</hi> that Inexorable <hi>Judge,</hi> will never reſtore her to the ſweet ſavour of her reputation.</p>
               <p>Full of this confidence hee accoſted this feined Kinſwoman, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little time hee bluntly made her underſtand, <hi>that</hi> not contented with that Alliance (which was but imaginary) hee pretended to a ſtraiter band, namely, that which of two <hi>Bodies</hi> makes but one <hi>Fleſh</hi> by the ſacred Lawes of <hi>Hymen. Almeria,</hi> laughing within her ſelf to ſee that with ſuch falſifying blows ſhee made ſuch reall wounds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all ſhee could to ſtrengthen <hi>Manile</hi>'s error, and having learned of <hi>Celian</hi> with what opinion hee had poſſeſt his Son concerning her, ſhee was prepared ſufficiently to jeer at that Dolt's ſimplicity; which having commmunicated to <hi>Merinda,</hi> you need not ask how they (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fields together) did ſolace themſelves with the conceit of his being ſo handſomely deceived.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Love</hi> be not the Mother, it is the Daughter of <hi>Idleneſs;</hi> and an antient Author calleth it, the Exerciſe and Occupation of <hi>lazie</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Manile,</hi> being Love-ſtricken, found many excuſes to leave his Plough, to ſeek out his miſtreſs <hi>Almeria,</hi> who with <hi>Merinda</hi> followed the Sheep to Paſture, and there hee diſcovered the depth of his Pretenſions. <hi>Almeria</hi> accommodating her Speech to the Lye which <hi>Celian</hi> had made of her, cunningly feined to bee very Penitent for her paſt Folly, and to reſolve to become wiſer for the Future; which kindled more flames in that Swain's rude breſt, than the Treacherous <hi>Sinon</hi> did caſt into <hi>Troy</hi> to conſume that ſtately City. It would be too tedious a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51476:54"/> thing to relate particularly the ſubtill Inventions of the witty <hi>Almeria</hi> to augment her <hi>Lover</hi>'s diſtemper: One while ſhee attracted him with her Refuſall's, another while ſhee charmed him with her faire Language; now ſhee would heighten his deſires to the higheſt pin, then kill all his hopes, repreſenting ſometimes to him by way of demand, if hee would bee contented to marry a crack't maid, or if hee did not fear that might bee a diſhonour to him; ſometimes againe faining to be fearfull her ſelf, that after their Marriage hee would bee apt to caſt that in her diſh upon the firſt diſlike: By theſe ſeverall motions (which might bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Ebbing and Flowing of the Tyde) ſhee put his Mind ſo out of frame, that hee knew not whereunto hee ſhould apply his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. But <hi>Love</hi> alwaies gained the Aſcendant over his other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; Inſomuch that deſpairing to gaine any thing of <hi>Almeria</hi> but by Marriage, hee reſolved to Conquer her that way; to which the feined Shepherdeſs oppoſing new difficulties, did like Smiths in their Forges, who with light aſperſions of Water increaſe the Ardour of their Fornaces. Hee, ſeeing his own Courtſhip prevailed nothing, took his Siſter <hi>Merinda</hi> apart (who hee perceived had ſome Credit with <hi>Almeria</hi>) conjuring her to bee favourable to him, and perſwade her Companion to accept of him for her Husband. <hi>Merinda</hi> being ready to burſt with laughing, had all the pain in the World to keep her Tongue from blabbing, and diſſemble what ſhee knew; but the fidelity which ſhee had ſworn to <hi>Almeria,</hi> forbad her to undeceive <hi>Manile</hi> by declaring the truth of the Story, only ſhee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to withdraw his thoughts from that Object, repreſenting to him <hi>how</hi> vaine and indiſcreet a thing it was for him to ſeek his Pleaſure to the prejudice of his Honour, <hi>that</hi> marrying one who formerly had lived looſely, it would be a perpetuall Reproach and Confuſion to him, if ever it came to bee divulged; <hi>Beſides, that</hi> Hee could not but bee in a continuall Jealouſie, and Apprehenſion leſt ſuch a wife ſhould return to her former lightneſs, and <hi>that</hi> the humours of Maids bred up in Citties were very hard to bee diſcerned, in regard they concealed as many crafty devices in their heads, as a <hi>Leopard</hi> diſcovereth ſpots in his skin. Yet all theſe Remonſtrances made no Impreſſion in <hi>Manile</hi>'s minde, being determined to have <hi>Almeria,</hi> or periſh: All this was but the beginning of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> in which thoſe Country-Spirits did finde themſelves involved.</p>
               <p>It hapned one day, as <hi>Merinda</hi> was looking for ſomething in her Trunk, that <hi>Remonda,</hi> her younger Siſter, came unexpectedly into the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51476:54"/> Chamber, where ſeeing a <hi>Man</hi>'s apparell, which ſeemed to her very coſtly, Curioſity (an accident inſeparable to the Nature of that Sex) egged her to inquire to whom thoſe Cloaths belonged. <hi>Merinda</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed a little at her demand, remained ſome time without replying; at length being urged to an anſwer, her affection (which had ſharpned her wit) ſuggeſted her to pay the other's Importunity with this ready Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>Theſe are the Cloathes,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>which</hi> Almeria <hi>wore when ſhee came for refuge hither. How</hi> Almeria? ſayd Remonda, <hi>Theſe are Men's Cloathes; That's granted,</hi> replyed Merinda, <hi>for ſhee disguiſed her ſelf in this habit to avoid the fury of her Parents, who would have Perſecuted her to Death. Why ſo?</hi> anſwered the inquiſitive Remonda, <hi>what had ſhee done? mee think's there is nothing more Sweet, nor faire conditioned than Shee.</hi> Then <hi>Merinda</hi> related to her the ſame Fiction wherewith <hi>Celian</hi> had fed the curioſity of <hi>Manile,</hi> with charge not to ſpeak of it for her life; which afterwards occaſioned a ſtrange confuſion. For, People of that Nature have never a greater itch to bee Tatling, than when they are commanded to be Silent, and the greater the danger is, the more are they tempted to reveal it. This was not all. <hi>Celian</hi> had another Son marryed to the Daughter of a rich Husbandman not far off, who ſince his Marriage lived in his Father-in-law's Houſe. <hi>Lupicin</hi> (ſo was this Elder Son called) coming ſometimes to viſite his Father, had no ſooner Inviſaged <hi>Almeria,</hi> but asking who ſhee was, <hi>Remonda</hi> told him all ſhee knew, and added of her own what her Imagination did dictate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee, being not very fond of his Wife, (whoſe diſpoſition was none of the meekeſt) entertained preſently a conceit that hee ſhould render her more carefull to pleaſe him, if in her preſence hee ſhould make ſhew of ſome inclination to <hi>Almeria;</hi> but the Event was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for ſhee grew horn-mad with Jealouſie.</p>

But Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie tranſported <hi>Remonda</hi> into ſtrange fits of Fury, ſeeing her ſelf robbed of the Eyes, Heart and Converſation of her <hi>Polemas,</hi> who (before hee had ſeen <hi>Almeria</hi>'s face) expreſſed ſo much affection, and ſealed his Proteſtations to her with ſo many Oaths. Whereupon this ſpightfull Female fell into ſuch tearms of Precipitation againſt <hi>Almeria,</hi> that ſhee did render her the moſt Infamous Creature under the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, adding to the Story <hi>Celian</hi> had framed, ſo many other horrid Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that it ſeemed <hi>Heaven</hi> had not Thunderbolts enough, nor the <hi>Earth</hi> Puniſhments ſufficient to expiate the Imaginary crimes of <hi>Almeria,</hi> which ſhee publiſhed every where for truths. If her Father chid or threatned her, that did but irritate her ſpleenfulll appetite of ſcandalizing the Innocent ſtranger. Yet for all this her Sweet-heart looked no more after her, his Paſſion for <hi>Almeria</hi> either ſtopping his ears againſt the injurious Reproaches which ſhee vomited againſt him, and this new Object of his thoughts, or elſe making him believe that it was meerly <hi>Calumnie</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Envie</hi> which poſſeſſed her, for being fruſtrated of his Services. <hi>Merinda</hi> who gave her the Lie at every turn, and who ſaid as much in defence of her Companion, effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by her commendations the malicious detraction of her Siſter: and in reſpect wee are apt to believe what wee deſire, that troop of Rivalls ſuffered themſelves to bee perſwaded by her that ſpake advantageouſly of the Common Object of their affections, rather than by her, whoſe invectives diſcovered ſo viſible a Paſſion, that had ſhee ſpoken truths, they would have ſounded in their Ears but as fictions.</p>
               <p>But as when bluſtering <hi>Boreas</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> wind are in contention, the Air and Sea are filled with Storms and Tempeſts, in ſuch ſort, that it ſeem's as if thoſe two Elements would exchange their Centers: So when <hi>Belida</hi>'s Jealouſie together with <hi>Remonda</hi>'s railing, came to joyn, or rather to oppoſe &amp; give the ſhock to <hi>Merinda</hi>'s juſtifications of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> it made as foul an Houſe as can be imagined to bee amongſt vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Women that quarrell, where all Speak and none Heare, Reaſon being baniſhed from their Pratling.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51476:55"/> And indeed what elſe can be expected from <hi>Ruſticks?</hi> Amongſt whom <hi>Fleurial</hi> was one of the moſt eager, who not knowing that his Brother-in-Law <hi>Lupicin</hi> made ſhew of love to <hi>Almeria</hi> for any other end than to reduce his Wife to Reaſon by ſome prick of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl upon the Fire of his Siſter's Fury, ſet her a Vomiting againſt her Husband ſuch outragious ſpeeches, as no diſcreet Woman would have been heard to utter. But her quality excuſed her ſomewhat, beſides a ſlight Impoſition of Hands which <hi>Lupicin</hi> made upon her Face, trying to ſtrike Dumb that Evill <hi>Spirit</hi> which made her ſcold with ſo much Inſolence. But when ſhee perceived that <hi>Fleurial</hi> was infected with the ſame Diſeaſe, and that hee began to talk of Marrying <hi>Almeria,</hi> ſhee expreſſed no leſs Impatience and Extremity of <hi>Choler</hi> againſt him, ſeeing hee would bring into their Family one, whom ſhee wiſhed under ground, or at leaſt at the World's end. What ſhee did and what ſhee ſaid to hinder that deſign, which ſhee foreſaw, would bee the Baniſhing of her from her Father's houſe, and the continuall Object of her <hi>Fear,</hi> or rather of her <hi>Fury,</hi> is needleſs here to mention.</p>
               <p>Mean time <hi>Almeria</hi> managed her Deportments and Favours with ſuch Induſtry and Modeſty, that Shee was the <hi>Idoll</hi> of all thoſe Peaſant's hearts, who Adored her as if ſhee had been a Mortall <hi>Goddeſs.</hi> But as it is impoſſible to force <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo it is hard to bend it and make it ſo pliable that it diſcover not ſome tokens of its reall <hi>Beeing. Achilles</hi> diſguiſed in woman's habit could not forbear handling of Weapons, beſides, his gate and diſcourſe did oftentimes betray him: onely <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> was able to appear directly other than what ſhee was, for, having been alwayes bred as a <hi>Man,</hi> and been poſſeſſed for a long time her ſelf that ſhee was ſo, <hi>Education</hi> had taken the place of <hi>Nature,</hi> and reteined almoſt all her qualities. It was not ſo with <hi>Almeria,</hi> for ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares and not heeding the perſonage ſhee was to repreſent, ſhee did let fall ſome generous words, and performed actions more Vigorous than ordinary Females are guilty of undertaking; which after ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made <hi>Fleurial &amp; Belida</hi> likewiſe harbour a ſuſpition, that ſhee was a <hi>Youth</hi> in <hi>Woman</hi>'s cloathing. Yet conſidering the ſweet attractive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her countenance, and the delicacy of her complexion, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their former opinion, thinking that ſhe was really ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and that perchance thoſe that had their breeding in Cities (for what may not people imagine of a manner of life whereof they have no knowledge?) were as dexterous and Valiant as <hi>Amazons,</hi> and no leſs capable of conquering with their Hands than with their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51476:56"/> Eyes. At length <hi>Belida,</hi> whether by the inevitable inſtinct of <hi>Nature,</hi> (whoſe ſecret vertues wee are not able to comprehend) or whether through the ſuſpition of that ſuit of Cloaths which <hi>Remonda</hi> had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, did feel certain motions, ſometimes of Hatred againſt <hi>Almeria,</hi> as believing her a <hi>Woman,</hi> and ſometimes of Affection, as fancying the contrary. Thus this Feaveriſh Paſſion which agitated her thoughts, made her fall from Heat to Cold, and from a chill Shivering, into a ſcalding Sweat. To relate what thoughts ran through the Brains of the four Pretendants, <hi>Manile, Fleurial, Antalcas,</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> were to no purpoſe: As for <hi>Lupicin,</hi> his deſign, as you have heard, was rather to puniſh his Croſs-grain'd Wive's perverſneſs, than for any other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Only <hi>Merinda</hi> and <hi>Celian,</hi> who knew the ſecret, did participate with their new Kinſwoman of the Divertiſement ſhee had in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Cozenage. Which <hi>Almeria</hi> longed to communicate to her dear <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as the moſt agreeable Paſtime that could be imagined: And to the end the Comedy might be exactly perfect, <hi>Celian</hi> and <hi>Merinda</hi> muſt likewiſe be brought into the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> which was thus, but not without an extream Intricacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> having once more loſt himſelf to finde out his <hi>Almeria,</hi> met <hi>Merinda</hi> with her (who ſtirred no more from that beloved Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, than the Shadow is ſeperated from the Body;) He was ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly Apparelled, that the ſilly Shepherdeſse's eyes were dazled at ſuch extraordinary Gallantry; but, if ſhee was amazed to ſee him, hee was no leſs ſurprized to meet her, for hee knew not how to bee rid of her, that hee might diſcourſe more freely with <hi>Almeria.</hi> At laſt hee told them that hee was one of the <hi>Palatine</hi>'s followers, who had loſt his way and Company in Hunting, but hee had reaſon to rejoyce at his beeing ſtrayed, ſince hee had found ſuch honeſt Virgins as might give him ſome directions. <hi>It muſt be my Siſter then,</hi> replyed <hi>Almeria, that muſt render you that good office, for I am Ignorant of the waies in this Forreſt, beeing a ſtranger, and arrived but very lately in theſe parts. Iphigenes,</hi> who asked no better than to fall into talk, without taking notice that he knew <hi>Almeria,</hi> ſaid, <hi>So mee think's Vertuous Shepherdeſs, for your Language is far different from that of this Province, and by your Face one may judge, that you are as unuſed to that habit, as unacquainted with the waies of the Country; if all Shepherdeſſes were like you, the Citties would become Deſarts, and the Deſarts bee quickly fill'd with People, many Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen would leave the</hi> Court, <hi>where nothing but Miſchief and Envie is practiſed, to apply themſelves to ſuch agreeable Objects and ſo worthy to bee
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51476:56"/> beloved.</hi> Here <hi>Merinda</hi> imagining that <hi>Almeria</hi>'s eyes had wounded the Gentleman's heart, as well as the Country Swain's, partly out of Jealouſie, partly out of Simplicity, briskly thus anſwerd, addreſſing her Speech to <hi>Almeria; In good earneſt, Couſin, I think the Gentlemen will fall in Love with you as well as the Plough-men, and that in the end you will ſet Fire in every place, if you take not heed. But you are too wiſe to hearken to ſuch</hi> Gallant's <hi>words, who ſo much contemn us Country-maids, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commend us but when they think the contrary, of what they ſay, or if they do ſpeak as they mean, it is but to abuſe us. And you,</hi> Sir, continued ſhee, turning her ſelf towards <hi>Iphigenes, ſhould do better to paſs on your way, without ſuffering your Mind to ſtray amongst us, as your Body hath done in theſe woods, that you may not loſe both together, and like an ill Hunts-man in ſtead of taking, bee taken your ſelf.</hi> The brave <hi>Palatine</hi> was not a little Aſtoniſhed at her Language: For, beſides that hee expected not ſuch clear <hi>Reaſons</hi> from ſo groſs a <hi>Soul,</hi> hee feared leſt by replying he might catch himſelf, and diſcover that hee had a better part than ſhee in the acquaintance of <hi>Almeria,</hi> who made him Signes with her Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Eyes not to take notice of her. Nevertheleſs not to remain abſolutely without anſwering, hee thus ſaid; <hi>Sweet-heart, You anſwer according to your own faſhion, that is, uncivilly, to one that treat's you with Courteſie; your Companion is better taught, and whether ſhee bee a Citizen, or hath had her Education in ſome Citty, as her Countenance, her Speech, and her Carriage do teſtifie, ſhee would have had more Civility than to have retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch an anſwer. The ſweetneſs which doth poliſh thoſe that are well bred, is eſteemed amongst you Ruſticks Treachery; for, you are Naturally ſo Diſtruſtfull, that when a man speaketh kindly to you, you think hee will betray you. You muſt not deal ſo ruggedly with a poor</hi> Gentleman <hi>that is Strayed, and who deſire's to bee put again into his way, the rather, that hee may bee rid of ſuch rude Converſation as yours. In ſooth that ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you</hi> (replyed Merinda) <hi>from leaving us in Peace, follow mee and I will ſet you in the way that ſhall lead you to the next Village, where you may bee farther informed of thoſe whom you ſeek</hi> This ſaid, ſhee advanced to direct him; But <hi>Almeria</hi> (who was unwilling to let ſlip this occaſion, the viſits of her <hi>Iphigenes</hi> being very rare) drew her back, and whiſpered ſoftly to her; <hi>Siſter, what is your meaning? I know this Gentleman, hee is one of my beſt Friends, and who may bee very uſefull to mee as my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now ſtands, doubtleſs hee doth not know mee in this habit; but if you pleaſe to retire your ſelf into yonder Copſe whilſt I Diſcourſe a little with him, you will oblige mee infinitely. Merinda,</hi> who deſired nothing more
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51476:57"/> than to pleaſe <hi>Almeria,</hi> thought her ſelf able to make no better excuſe on the ſodain than to ſatisfie her demand.</p>
               <p>Shee beeing thus ſeparated to give the two Friends liberty to talk freely together, it cannot bee expreſt what pleaſure <hi>Iphigenes</hi> took in hearing from the Mouth of the Feined <hi>Almeria</hi> the Relation of thoſe Flames which ſhee had kindled in thoſe Ruſtick Souls, and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty wherein they were of her Sex, by reaſon of the different Tales already mentioned. Whereof beeing willing not onely to take ſhare himſelf, but to make ſome of his Favorites participant likewiſe, that they might recreate themſelves with the ſimplicity of thoſe <hi>Swains,</hi> they conſpired ſo to lay their Plot, that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> might bee abuſed as well as the Clowns. Great Perſons would not eſteem their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, if they were not ſingular; for, as their Condition raiſeth them above the Vulgar, their Entertainments, their Occupations and their Divertiſements ought not to bee Common. <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> like Bodies o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd with Fat, draweth ſo many Inconveniences after it, that thoſe that are in important Charges, and elevated to high degrees of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, are glad ſometimes to pack up all that Baggage of <hi>Vanity</hi> which environ's them, to lead by ſtealth a low, popular and obſcure Life, mingling themſelves amongſt the Lees of the People, and abaſing their Dignities to the condition of the loweſt Subjects, of whom the Plough drivers march in the laſt Rank, beeing (as it were) the Earthen Feet of that <hi>Statue</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſaw in his Dream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almeria,</hi> whoſe ſpirit <hi>Ambition</hi> much more diſquieted, than theſe Recreations delighted, deſired <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in mean time to tell her how hee would diſpoſe of her after thoſe Rurall Merriments were paſt; Whereupon <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (who aymed at nothing but to divert the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhee bare to <hi>Clemencia</hi>) propoſed the Deſire hee had to raiſe her to a great Fortune (this was to feel how her Pulſe beat, by the pretention of <hi>Glory</hi>) by Marrying her to <hi>Simphoroza,</hi> or the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> her Mother, to the end hee might divert her Paſſion, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her from breaking off his own Marriage with <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> in the Continuation whereof <hi>Liante's</hi> honour did ſeem to be ingaged. But if all that failed, Hee promiſed to give her his Ward, <hi>Leonora</hi> Daughter to <hi>Staniſlas,</hi> whoſe Eſtate hee might have injoyed as well as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Palatine,</hi> if hee had liſted, the <hi>King</hi> having given him the confiſcation. All theſe Propoſitions were as many ſpecious Ports to let <hi>Liante</hi> (hidden under the name of <hi>Almeria,</hi> and with the veil of a Shepherdeſs) forth of that odious condition, wherein <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51476:57"/> him, and gave him at the ſame time entrance into <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> after which hee ſo ardently did thirſt. But all this diſguiſed Nymph could do during the ſhort ſpace of their Interlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was to remit the conduct of all her <hi>Fortune</hi> into the hands of the beloved <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> to whom ſhee needed not to have made ſo ſtrict a Recommendation, ſince therein Hee laboured for his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>In mean time they reſolved to play the <hi>Country-men</hi> the pleaſanteſt Trick that could bee imagined: for ground whereof they agreed that within few dayes <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> accompanied by ſome of his Friends, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like Peaſants, ſhould come to a certain Neighboring Village (where a Wake or ſome ſuch Solemnity was to aſſemble a multitude of <hi>Country-People</hi>) and that they ſhould make ſhew of beeing in love with <hi>Almeria,</hi> to ſee what mettle <hi>Jealouſie</hi> would put into the four <hi>Rivalls</hi> already mentioned. And to leave the ſeeds of ſome ſuſpition in <hi>Merinda's</hi> Soul, they thought it would not bee improper, that <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> taking leave of <hi>Almeria,</hi> ſhould now and then miſtake himſelf, ſpeaking ſometimes as if ſhee were a <hi>Man,</hi> and ſometimes as if ſhee were a <hi>Maid,</hi> in ambiguous tearms promiſing to aſſiſt her; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to cover her ſhame, as if ſhee had been a defloured Virgin; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to obtain her Grace, as if ſhee had been guilty of Homicide, which the ingenious <hi>Iphigenes</hi> carried with ſuch dexterity, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> knew not where ſhee was, but thought ſhee had been inchanted. And indeed what with the Doubts and Suſpitions, 'twixt which her ſpirits ſwam, beſides the diſcourſe which ſhee heard, there was enough to diſturb a much ſtronger Brain than her's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> having left them to their own liberties, <hi>By the Faith of a Maid</hi> (ſayd <hi>Merinda</hi> to <hi>Almeria) I know not what to think, whether you are</hi> Fiſh or Fleſh; <hi>to my ſenſe you are like the</hi> Otters <hi>of our</hi> Marſhes, <hi>which are both Terreſtriall and Aquatick Creatures, or like our</hi> Geeſe <hi>which live in both Elements; for, if I conſider the Lineaments of your Face, they are ſo attractive, and your Complexion ſo delicate, that I do not wonder, if in the Opinon of all our young Men you paſs for a</hi> Maid; <hi>On the other ſide, when I look upon your ſtoutneſſe of Heart, and vigorous activity of Body, I cannot but perſwade my ſelf that you are of the Sex of that Habit which I have in keeping for you: But, when I recall to my thoughts the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs of your carriage to mee, who yet have never ſeen you do the leaſt Action, nor speak the leaſt word that ſhewed you to be a Man, that make's mee conceit that you are like mee, and whileſt I laugh to ſee others deceived
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51476:58"/> in their purſuits, I am fruſtrated my ſelfe of my Expectation. Therefore without holding mee any longer in ſuſpenſe, you will oblige mee very much to deliver my minde of this Perplexity. Almeria</hi> (like <hi>Hunts-men</hi> and <hi>Fowlers,</hi> who glad to ſee the innocent Creatures fall into their Gins, in ſtead of untangling them doe ingage them further in their Snares, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſtruggle and torment themſelves untill their own wearineſs make's them conſent to their taking) in ſtead of caſing <hi>Merinda</hi> of her pain, led her about with ſo many ambiguous Circumlocutions, that after a tedious Diſcourſe ſhee left her no leſs unſatisfied than before, caſting her by thoſe intricate Explanations into a greater Obſcurity, than that of her former uncertainties. Whereupon ſaid the trouled <hi>Merinda, Thus the City-Wits, more ſlippery than Lampreys, riggle from us when wee think to graſp them: but in ſhort, I have onely one queſtion to ask you,</hi> Are you Man or Woman? Then <hi>Almeria,</hi> who took pleaſure in this confuſion, told her, <hi>That ſhee was extreamly ſorry that ſhee had ſo long deceived her, in ſaying ſhee was a</hi> Man, <hi>for in effect ſhee was an unfortunate</hi> Maid; <hi>that thinking to tell her Sister a lie, ſhee had told her Truth, like a blinde Man that ſhooting at a Mark doth ſometimes hit it by chance, Hazard ſupplying the defect of Addreſs. However ſhee intreated her, if ſhee was thereby deprived of her Affection, that ſhee might not loſe her Friendſhip, which ſhee ſaw was very neceſſary for her Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not reſolving after her fault to caſt her ſelf into the precipice of her totall ruine, hoping that</hi> Heaven <hi>taking pity of her repentance, would create in the Heart of him that had abuſed her, the deſire of repairing her honour by Marriage, by which means ſhee might bee re-establiſhed in her Eſtate, and regain her Parent's Favour.</hi> To deſcribe the aſtoniſhment, together with the regret which ſeized on <hi>Merinda</hi> at this confeſſion, is beyond my ability: for this Truth was not a little odious to her, and had not <hi>Compaſſion</hi> taken the place of the Aſhes of <hi>Love,</hi> whoſe coals were dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a ſodain, ſhee had made foul Work.</p>
               <p>This Counter-point hurried her into the participation of <hi>Remonda's,</hi> and her Siſter-in-law's Jealouſies, and her Scoffing and Laughing at thoſe young Men, who expreſſed ſuch Paſſion for this ſtranger, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her memory, put her into ſtrange diſtempers. I need not repeat the Reproaches ſhee made againſt <hi>Almeria,</hi> in regard her <hi>Anger</hi> was like to a ſtorm, which after much Thunder and Rain, leave's nothing but Dirt and Vapors: for, <hi>Almeria</hi> had ſuch an Art to pacifie her, that ſhee pardoned her that Deceipt, conſidering that broken <hi>Maids</hi> would do what they could to hide their Faults, there beeing nothing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51476:58"/> ſo naturall as to ſhun ſhame. For the better effecting whereof, ſhee prayed her to ſpread a rumor under-hand amongſt the People of the Village, that ſhee was a <hi>Man,</hi> to the end ſhee might remain unſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and likewiſe <hi>Remonda</hi> and <hi>Belida</hi> bee cured of their Jealouſies. Whereof <hi>Merinda</hi> would not have failed, though ſhee had not been intreated, there beeing but one point which obligeth a <hi>Maid</hi> to keep a buſineſs ſecret, that is, <hi>when ſhee her ſelf is intereſſed;</hi> take away that <hi>Flood-gate</hi> and ſhee will diſgorge like a full Mill-Dam. Beſides, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> had reaſon to foment this ſuppoſition, to repeal <hi>Antalcas</hi> to his former obſervance of her, and cure her ſelf of the reall jealouſie which ſhee might conceive, if hee continued his Courting of <hi>Almeria:</hi> whom ſhee had no ſooner left, but, like a perſon who ſodainly ſhake's off a Coale that flie's upon his cloaths, ſhee ran to acquaint her Father with the Diſcovery, telling him <hi>that</hi> Almeria <hi>was indeed a</hi> Maid, <hi>who under</hi> Man's <hi>cloathing had eſcaped from the fury of her Parents, who would have waſhed in her Blood the Honour, which ſhee had ſtained and raviſhed from them.</hi> This ſtartled the old Man at firſt, believing his Daughter might have had ſome proofs, which thoſe of her <hi>Sex</hi> might gather with more Certainty and Modeſty than <hi>Men.</hi> But (when hee perceived that her drift was to perſwade him <hi>to turn her ſpeedily out of dores, otherwiſe hee would nouriſh a Viper that would be his Deſtruction, and keep a fatall fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand which would reduce his whole Family into Aſhes, beſides the Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he would reap by harboring an idle light Huſwife in his Houſe</hi>) he ſtopped her Mouth with a Multitude of Arguments in <hi>Almeria's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, feeling the profit ſweet which hee got by her, his Heart beeing of the Compoſition of thoſe mercenary Spirits, who for an Ounce of <hi>Gold</hi> would give an hundred weight of <hi>Honour. Merinda</hi> ſeeing that her Speeches availed nothing with her Father, to excite him to diſmiſs her, whom ſhee feared as much, believing her to bee a <hi>Maid,</hi> as ſhee loved, whileſt ſhee thought her to bee a <hi>Man;</hi> beſides, conſidering that in ſtead of apprehending that <hi>Manile</hi> would Marry her, hee ſeemed to hold the imaginary Ignominy of that Alliance too great an Honour, not believing that (although ſhee was a Fugitive) ſhee would condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to any ſuch Bargain; at length, ſhee let him alone, and turning her courſe, ſhee reſolved to diſperſe the uncertainty of her Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among her Brothers and Siſters, not ſo much to oblige <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> (as ſhee had promiſed) as to ſatisfie her own ſpightfull Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>To her Siſter <hi>Remonda</hi> (as if ſhee had eſcaped ſome great danger)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51476:59"/> ſhee related, <hi>how ſhee had thought to have undon her ſelf by frequenting</hi> Almeria's <hi>company, believing that ſhee had been really a</hi> Maid (<hi>as ſhee had poſſeſſed</hi> Celian <hi>and</hi> her) <hi>but that ſhee now had found that Hee was a wicked</hi> Man, <hi>who having committed ſome Villanous Action, to avoid the hands of the</hi> Juſtice, <hi>was fled to hide himſelf in thoſe Woods, and not thinking himſelf yet ſufficiently concealed, unleſs hee denied his</hi> Sex, <hi>he had covered his Knavery under the Habit of a ſimple Shepherdeſs. If I ſhould tell my</hi> Father <hi>or my</hi> Brother, <hi>what violence that</hi> Traytour <hi>offered to mee</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Shee) <hi>I believe they would tear him in a thouſand pieces, unleſs my</hi> Father <hi>bee too much blinded with the Gold which hee hath cast into his Eyes; for old Folk generally are of that Diſpoſition, that Lucre make's them neglect all Honour.</hi> How do you think was <hi>Remonda</hi> affected with this Diſcourſe? In ſtead of continuing in her former frenzy, which <hi>Merinda's</hi> intention was to reſuſcitate, ſhee felt on a ſodain all her <hi>choler</hi> vaniſh, and gently ſlipping into it's place an agreeable ſweetneſs, like unto that delightfull poyſon which is called <hi>Love.</hi> The winning Graces of <hi>Almeria</hi> (as a <hi>Man</hi>) repreſented themſelves to her Eyes in a more lovely form than ever, and turning her <hi>Paſſion</hi> in an inſtant, of a Mortall <hi>Enemy,</hi> ſhee became a voluntary <hi>ſlave</hi> to her, whom <hi>Jealouſie</hi> had made her hate. Oh how ſhee than repented that ſhee had ſpoken ſo unworthily of the worthieſt Subject in the World! How much ſhee apprehended leſt her brawling and invective Speeches might bee an Obſtacle to the Conqueſt, which ſhee projected of that Golden Fleece! Shee tranſplanted all her <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> into her Siſter's Breſt, and having in exchange imbraced her Affection, in ſtead of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Almeria</hi> for the violence, which ſhee thought ſhee had offered to the pudicity of <hi>Merinda,</hi> perchance ſhee would rather have excuſed than accuſed the like attempt upon her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merinda</hi> made the like Relation to <hi>Belida,</hi> who preſently felt her ſelf eaſed of that <hi>Head-ache</hi> which troubled her, by reaſon of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's ſhew of affection to <hi>Almeria,</hi> and in ſtead of ſeconding <hi>Merinda</hi> in that <hi>choler</hi> (wherewith ſhee feined to bee tranſported againſt that diſguiſed Raviſher) ſhee told her, <hi>that to make any further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints would bee but a needleſs trouble, and that it was better to turn into laughter the Paſſions of thoſe Men, who were ſo inamored of that ſuppoſed</hi> Maid, <hi>and caſt in their Faces the confuſion of having neglected the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Objects of their reall</hi> Loves, <hi>to run after</hi> a Shadow. So <hi>Merinda</hi> finding no more Diſpoſition in her Siſter-in-Law, than in <hi>Remonda,</hi> to back the Deſign ſhee had of chaſing away <hi>her,</hi> whom ſhee could not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51476:59"/> love as a <hi>Maid,</hi> (perchance becauſe ſhee had diſcloſed ſomething, which ſhee then wiſht ſhee had concealed, and which ſhee feared would bee diſcovered by the Frailty of her <hi>Sex,</hi> whom ſhee knew to bee in the impoſſibility of ſilence) ſhee reſolved to continue her Plot, and beget a belief in her Brother <hi>Manile,</hi> and by his means in the reſt, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria</hi> was a <hi>Man,</hi> whom ſome heynous crime had obliged to take that diſguiſe, thinking thereby to make them hunt her away, leſt beeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Juſtice, they might bee brought in queſtion and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned as harborers and complices of his crime.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Belida</hi> was glad to hear this <hi>Maid</hi> was a <hi>Man,</hi> changing her <hi>Gall</hi> into <hi>Hony,</hi> and the ſharp prickles of her <hi>Hatred</hi> into the ſweet flowers of <hi>Friendſhip, Manile</hi> was no leſs afflicted at this news; for, it was the burying of that amiable <hi>Paſſion</hi> which inlivened him, and which fed his imagination with the moſt agreeable Fancies, that ever hee had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented. As if a Thunderbolt had ſwept the ground under his Feet, and a flaſh of Lightning ſealed up his Eyes; or, as if hee had received a great Knock with a Club upon the Head, ſo hee ſtood amazed for a good while without any motion of Body or Tongue. At length, as, although the Fire bee out, the Aſhes yet remain warm; So <hi>Pitty</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Heart of this Ruſtick the place of <hi>Love,</hi> which was quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by this Relation, Hee anſwered, <hi>That however, they ought to have compaſſion of thoſe that were in affliction, and not to commit ſo baſe a Treachery as to betray a poor criminall, who did what hee could to ſhelter himſelf from the rigour of</hi> Juſtice, <hi>that it would bee a very unworthy part for Protectors to become Sergeants, that the Sanctuary ſhould prove the Ruine, and ſerve as a Priſon to thoſe that fled thither for refuge, thinking to find their Liberty and ſafeguard; thoſe Harbors beeing very unfortunate where veſſells were caſt away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpightfull <hi>Female</hi> ſeeing hee made no more account of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints than the reſt, repaired to <hi>Lupicin,</hi> who was very glad of that advertiſement; for, having no other end in following <hi>Almeria,</hi> than to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Wife, he thought it might be a means to make her ſee her folly, when that verity ſhould come to bee divulged. <hi>Fleurial, Lupicin's</hi> Wive's Brother, was no leſs aſtoniſhed than <hi>Manile,</hi> when it came to his ears, Oh! how hee wiſhed it had been falſe, although hee believed it was too true, <hi>Merinda</hi> had the skill to relate it with ſuch reſentments of a Virgin, the treaſure of whoſe integrity (ſhee pretended) <hi>Almeria</hi> would have raviſhed. Onely <hi>Antalcas, quondam</hi> ſervant to <hi>Merinda,</hi> had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that what ſhee alleadged was a meer ſuppoſition, invented to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51476:60"/> confound him, for forſaking her to Court the ſtrange Shepherdeſs: for, hee carryed the perfections of <hi>Almeria</hi> ſo deeply ingraven in his breſt, that hee needed a more Authentick proof than a bare report to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe him, ſo, hee ſent her away very ruggedly, telling her <hi>that hee was not ſo Credulous, and that ſhee ſpake out of Envie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſumm, whileſt all thoſe eyes, like ſo many <hi>Arguſſes,</hi> were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obſerving every particular geſture of <hi>Almeria,</hi> ſhee had the wit ſo Dexterouſly to hold the Ballance in this Ambiguity, that ſhee led thoſe Ruſticks (as they ſay) by the <hi>Noſe,</hi> like <hi>Bears</hi> that are Blind and Muzled. For, the <hi>Men</hi> by her <hi>Womaniſh</hi> behaviour, which ſhee acted to the life, were confident ſhee was of that Sex; And that to avoid their Importunities, ſhee had made <hi>Merinda</hi> publiſh that Lye: But <hi>Belida</hi> and <hi>Remonda</hi> applying their Obſervations more particularly to thoſe Actions that ſpake her, as they deſired her, had a conceit that <hi>Merinda</hi> had invented that Stratagem to preſerve that prize to her ſelf, in imitation of Nurſes who lay Muſtard upon their Nipples, when they have a mind to wean their Children, to make them ſhun the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs in the ſame place, whence they Sucked the ſweet nouriſhment of their lives. Thus <hi>Remonda</hi> taking <hi>Merinda</hi>'s turn, declared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Ceremony her Paſſion to <hi>Almeria,</hi> telling him that ſhee had ſeen his Cloathes, and that ſhee knew his Condition; And <hi>Belida,</hi> who would pay her Husband in his own Coyn, and make his Brains crow another while, began to make extraordinary careſſes to <hi>Almeria,</hi> which were much leſs ſupportable than her <hi>Envie</hi> and <hi>Detraction.</hi> And <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> (though ſhee ſtudyed to ſhun the ſight of <hi>Almeria</hi> with no leſs care, than ſhee had formerly deſired it with eagerneſs whileſt her ſenſe made her hope for ſome ſatisfaction) could not forbear looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (like the woman that was Metamorphoſed into a pillar of Salt) and to call ſome Scruples into her mind, that perchance <hi>Almeria</hi> to bee rid of her importunities, made her believe that ſhee was a <hi>Maid,</hi> when ſhee was otherwiſe. The importance of all this was, that every one champed on his Bit in Silence, and out of the <hi>Maſs</hi> of divers thoughts, could not draw one <hi>Drachm</hi> of reſolution.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ruſtick's heads being thus Intoxicated, a Solemnity in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Village invited the Country-people to aſſemble there; <hi>Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> ſeeming to bee unwilling to go thither, out of fear of beeing known, augmented by her backwardneſs the deſire of her Suitors to ſee her appear amongſt the other Laſſes, like the <hi>Moon</hi> neer her full amongſt the ſmaller <hi>Lights,</hi> which the <hi>Night</hi> diſplayeth in the <hi>Firmament.</hi> At
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51476:60"/> length by much wooing and intreaty, ſhee ſuffered her ſelf to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to bear <hi>Belida</hi> and <hi>Remonda</hi> company, who left her the leaſt they could; <hi>Merinda</hi> likewiſe, beeing deſirous to ſee the paſtime, was forced to joyn with them, and re-accoſt <hi>Almeria,</hi> who caſt ſuch glances upon her as penetrated her very <hi>Soul,</hi> and without ſpeaking a word, reproached openly enough her unworthineſs. Whileſt they are upon the way, let us take the time to relate the plot which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> layed to render inviſible to the eyes of his friends the <hi>Paſſion</hi> which hee intended to make viſible to <hi>Almeria,</hi> but in ſuch a manner as I want words to expreſs it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomeran</hi> beeing his boſome friend, Hee took <hi>him</hi> into his Cloſet, where hee thus diſcloſed his mind unto him: <hi>Dear friend, can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any thing from thee that come's neer my</hi> Heart, <hi>ſince thou takeſt ſo much part in my joyes or Diſpleaſures? No certainly, unleſs I would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy Friendſhip, which obligeth mee to an Intire confidence.</hi> Alas! <hi>At our laſt Hunting, whileſt you having the</hi> Hart <hi>at a Bay, were making a Prey of him, I doubly loſt my ſelf in the</hi> Foreſt, <hi>and have Inthralled my</hi> Heart, <hi>but in ſuch a Bondage as I eſteem above any Freedome;</hi> Love <hi>hath made beoty of my</hi> Liberty, <hi>by the Incounter of a Shepherdeſs, who doth ſo much reſemble the only Object which delight's my Soul (that is, my Wife, my dear</hi> Modeſtina) <hi>that at firſt bluſh I thought ſhee had been eſcaped out of the Priſon, where the Cruelty of my Father reteineth her, and had concealed her ſelf in theſe Woods, diſguiſed thus, purpoſely to accoſt mee, and learn the reſentments of my</hi> Soul. <hi>But by her Converſation I perceived it was not ſhee, though this hath a good wit for a</hi> Country-<hi>girl, accompanyed with an Incomparable</hi> Modeſty: <hi>I have ſhewed thee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times her Picture, which I alwaies wear next my</hi> Heart, <hi>where her</hi> Idea <hi>is ſo lively Ingraven; by that thou wilt diſcern their likeneſs when thou ſeeſt this ſweet Object of my Divertiſement: For, really I muſt confeſs, ſince I have met with this living</hi> Copy, <hi>that</hi> Picture <hi>hath ſemed dead to mee, and if I have Strayed ſometimes in the</hi> Foreſt, <hi>I may tell thee, it hath been to ſeek out this</hi> Image <hi>of my only</hi> Joy, <hi>the</hi> Originall <hi>whereof is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined from my ſight, by the Imperious command, I dare not ſay</hi> Cruelty <hi>of my Father. And although I confeſs there is an extream difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Merits of my</hi> Lady <hi>and this</hi> Shepherdeſs, <hi>yet this deceipt is as ſweet to mee, as that of an agreeable dream, which when wee awake makes us ſorry it laſted no longer. I wiſh</hi> the Heavens <hi>may never pardon mee, nay contrary, I deſire that my head may ſerve for a Butt to all their Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, if in this pleaſing imagination I have any deſign that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51476:61"/> to Vertue. I know what I owe to</hi> God <hi>and my own</hi> Soul, <hi>what I owe to the Glory of my Birth and Quality; I know what the inviolable</hi> Fidelity <hi>is, which I have ſworn to my</hi> Wife, <hi>and I ſhould bee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulleſt Creature breathing, if I did not correſpond to the ſincerity of her</hi> Affections <hi>to mee: thou mayeſt believe mee, were I to dye a thouſand times, and by a thouſand ſorts of new torments, I would rather undergoe them all, than commit an act of</hi> Diſloyalty <hi>againſt</hi> Her, <hi>or with</hi> This <hi>of whom I speak. For I hold, that to</hi> Love <hi>without</hi> Honour, <hi>(beſides that it is an</hi> Infamy) <hi>is rather</hi> Pain <hi>than</hi> Pleaſure, <hi>and thoſe Siniſter intentions are for the moſt part ſhamefull, and abhor the light; Which is quite contrary to mine, for I do not only declare unto you my</hi> Paſſion, <hi>but I deſire, if you pleaſe, to make you participant of my</hi> Pleaſure. <hi>Thoſe that aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſuch delights, as are common to us and Brutes, cannot endure any companions in their injoyments, being covetous to poſſeſs alone what they deſire with as much</hi> Impurity <hi>as</hi> Impatience: <hi>But chaſt</hi> Love <hi>is not ſubject to any of thoſe Frenzies, it's</hi> Jealouſie <hi>look's no farther than the</hi> deſire <hi>of rendring it ſelf more perfect, more amiable, more accompliſht; to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, not alone, but better than others.</hi> Reaſon <hi>is the Conductor of this pure</hi> Affection, <hi>whereas ſhee is baniſhed from all illicite</hi> Paſſions. <hi>All that I pretend in this Divertiſement, which I am about to tell you, is only to amuſe that concupiſcible Faculty which is Naturall to us, (and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee void, that is, uſeleſs in us) in giving it an Object, whoſe Simplicity can no waies leſſen or cauſe any alteration of the Sincere affection which I bear</hi> Modeſtina: <hi>Let the</hi> Heavens <hi>ſo proſper mee, as I Honour and am Faithfull to</hi> her, <hi>&amp; may I injoy no longer</hi> Life <hi>than I preſerve my</hi> Loyalty <hi>to</hi> her; <hi>But, as in ſtead of beeing offended, I am ſure ſhe would be well pleaſed to know that in her abſence I ſhould love and make a thouſand careſſes to her</hi> Picture; <hi>So, I believe that rendring but Honourable and chaſt Devoirs to her living</hi> Image, <hi>I ſhall not prejudice the</hi> Faith <hi>which I owe</hi> her, <hi>ſeeing I do not cheriſh this</hi> Figure, <hi>but in conſideration of</hi> her <hi>whom it repreſents, amuſing my ſelf therewith as an Innocent Child would do about a</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, <hi>to divert the</hi> Melanchollie <hi>and disguſts which accompany my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</hi>

                  <hi>You may ſay what you pleaſe,</hi> replyed POMERAN, <hi>for believe mee,</hi> Sir, <hi>it is impoſſible to speak ſo feelingly, and cry up the merits of any Subject with ſuch Vehemency, without beeing touched with that</hi> Frenzie <hi>which turne's the ſtrongest Brains. I dare not queſtion your</hi> Fidelity <hi>to</hi> Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina, <hi>but as a Feaver is known by the Alteration, and by the Tongue is obſerved the indiſpoſition of the Stomack; ſo by the diſcourſe is diſcovered
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51476:61"/> the Intention of the Heart, ſince out of the abundance thereof the Mouth ſpeaketh. The</hi> Image <hi>you ſo much adore, is too reall and too lively, to make mee believe that you cheriſh the Preſent only by Imagination, and the Abſent in Effect; if you are not very cunning, and well-ſented, you are now in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of taking a</hi> change; <hi>theſe Savage Creatures have oftentimes ſuch Wiles, as the experteſt Hunts-men are never able to finde out. Any other Paſſion elſe may bee ſo handſomely diſſembled, that a</hi> Man <hi>may cheat the Eyes of the moſt Circumſpect, but in this, which carries away the</hi> Heart <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, it is not the</hi> Mouth <hi>but the bottom of the</hi> Soul <hi>which ſpeaketh. Some do perſwade themſelves they Love very much, when they are not touched with the leaſt Affection, and others ſometimes do think they have but a ſpark of that Fire, when all their Bowells are on a Flame. Make no jeſt of this,</hi> Iphigenes, <hi>for whileſt you think to catch, you may be caught, and believing to deceive others, you may be abuſed your ſelf. For the moſt part this dangerous</hi> Paſſion, <hi>(the Murthereſs of our</hi> Honour <hi>and the Enemy of our</hi> Repoſe,) <hi>inſinuate's it ſelf and ſlip's into our Souls under ſuch ſpecious pretexts, and by ſuch plauſible means, that with the Sugar wee ſwallow the Poyſon, and contribute all wee can to our perdition. You ſay it is only for sport, and to recreate your diſcontented Mind, and that there is nothing of evill, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencie in it; Can there I pray, be any thing more misbecoming, than to ſee a</hi> Man <hi>great by Extraction, great by Quality, great in Eſteem, and great in Courage, abaſe his thoughts ſo low as to Court a</hi> Shepherdeſs? <hi>You, who have the Honour to deſerve (what diſgrace of</hi> Fortune <hi>ſoever may bee imagined by this retirement from</hi> Court) <hi>the Affection of both their</hi> Majeſties, <hi>what will they they ſay of this Fantaſie, but that</hi> Lucifer <hi>is fallen from</hi> Heaven, <hi>and that you have precipitated your ſelf from the Verticall point of</hi> Honour <hi>into the</hi> Center <hi>of</hi> Dejection <hi>by ſome ſort of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair? <hi>Indeed you prepare matter for your</hi> Calumniators, <hi>who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to triumph over your</hi> Innocencie, <hi>will add to their Trophies the Laughter at your</hi> Follie. <hi>Pardon mee</hi> Sir, <hi>if I ſpeak ſo boldly to you, the exceſs of my</hi> Affection <hi>to your Perſon paſſeth the</hi> Reverence <hi>which I owe to your Quality, and I ſhould eſteem my ſelf a Traytor, if I ſhould conceal ſo remarkable a Verity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a multitude of other diſſwaſive Arguments, which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> refuted with no leſs ſubtility and eagerneſs, than <hi>Pomeran</hi> alledged them with Cordiall tenderneſs, <hi>Wee ſhall never have done conteſting,</hi> ſaid Iphigenes, <hi>unleſs I quite unbutton my breaſt to you, which I will do,</hi> Pomeran, <hi>with as much Freedom as I have Confidence in your Fidelity. This Fire which you think ſo great, or which you fear will grow to ſe great
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51476:62"/> a Blaze, is but a little ſpark which I deſire to Choak, not to Cheriſh; For, beſide the ſolemn Proteſtations which I make to</hi> Heaven, <hi>never to admit within my</hi> Soul <hi>any thought of</hi> Unfaithfulneſs <hi>or</hi> Impurity, <hi>I muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely have renounced all</hi> Honour <hi>and</hi> Reaſon, <hi>if I ſhould ſuffer my</hi> deſires <hi>to ſtoop ſo low as the Condition of</hi> Almeria: <hi>But this is a plot which I have invented (wherein I have need of your aſſiſtance to cover my diſſimulation) that</hi> Reſpicia <hi>loſing all hopes of conquering me, and my</hi> Father, <hi>fearing leſt this fantaſie may ruine my</hi> Fortune, <hi>may conſent to render mee poſſeſſor of my</hi> Modeſtina, <hi>without whom mee-think's the light of the</hi> Sun <hi>is irksome to my ſight. Judge you then,</hi> Dear Friend, <hi>if my Intention bee unjust, or my wounds inflamed by the remedy which I apply to them. This would not bee the firſt time,</hi> anſwered Pomeran, <hi>that the Antidote were changed into poiſon. Violent cures are alwaies dangerous, wee never make uſe of Irons and Fire but in extremities, and when 'tis feared that the</hi> Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene <hi>will haſten</hi> Death. <hi>Wee cannot judge of Counſels and Enterpriſes by the beginning, but by the Event. It hapneth oftentimes that a Mutinous People ſeeking to ſhake off the Yoak of their Naturall and Legitimate</hi> Prince, <hi>do fall by their revolting under the</hi> Domination <hi>of a ſtrange</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>not acquiring the Liberty which they pretended, but having only changed a bad</hi> Maſter <hi>for a worſe.</hi> Phyſick <hi>is not alwaies in ſeaſon, and that which is good for one, is hurtfull to another; That which you are about to take, is as if in ſtead of caſting your ſelf from a precipice, you ſhould fall into the Fire. Some potions are harder to bee taken, than our Diſeaſes to bee ſupported; and mee-think's there is an Hook under this Bait: Therefore I conjure you by all the glory which accompanies you, to manage well and bee charie of your</hi> Renown; <hi>bee not carried away inconſiderately by theſe</hi> Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>which will render you no leſs ridiculous, than you have hitherto been remarkable for ſo many</hi> Heroick <hi>and Generous Actions.</hi>

There was none but <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> (Foſter-Father and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to <hi>Iphigenes</hi>) who participated of the truth of this Story, or knew whereunto tended the <hi>Morall</hi> of this <hi>Fable.</hi> Hee had already (diſguiſed like a Traveller) been to confer with <hi>Almeria,</hi> of whom hee learnt the Diſpoſitions of thoſe Ruſtick Spirits, wherewith ſhee was environed; and the Politick Old Man (by whoſe counſell <hi>Iphigenes</hi> chiefly directed his courſe) caſt now and then into the Soul of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Shepherdeſs certain hopes which gently flattered Her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
               <p>All things beeing thus ordered, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with his three Friends, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meran, Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides,</hi> not forgetting <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> whom hee called <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> marched like Country-fellowes to the Village where the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was; thither likewiſe came <hi>Almeria,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Belida, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monda</hi> and <hi>Merinda,</hi> uſhered by <hi>Lupicin</hi> and the four Competitours. <hi>Manile, Fleurial, Antalcas</hi> and <hi>Polemas.</hi> To make a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe <hi>Reall</hi> Ruſticks and theſe <hi>diſguiſed ones,</hi> I had need have the Pencill of that <hi>Painter,</hi> who (with onely turning the Picture) of an Horſe that was tumbling in the duſt, made one running full ſpeed, and beating the duſt in his Carreer. I will not here amuſe my ſelf in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Antick, nor abuſe the time and the Reader's Patience with the Repreſentation of a County-ſolemnity; I ſhall onely ſay that our Strangers appeared amongſt thoſe rough-hewen <hi>Boors,</hi> like that golden Sand which ſhines amongſt the gravell of the River <hi>Tagus.</hi> There were no Eyes but for them, nor any but upon them. They carried away with ſuch advantage the Glory in all the Exerciſes, as Dancing, Wreſtling, Jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Slinging of Stones, flinging the Bar, Shooting, or whatſoever, that they ſeemed as if they were come thither purpoſely to dazle the ſight of all that did behold them: But their Carriage beeing too gentile for ſuch mean Habits, their cleer Complexions and their ſtudied Slights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them. Every one ask't, <hi>Who are they? whence are they?</hi> but no body could give an account. This bred a ſuſpition that there was ſome Plot in their coming, and that they were ſome cunning Shavers that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſurpriſe them. To repeat you the Diſcourſe of theſe <hi>Stage-Peaſants,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:51476:64"/> would bee too long and Frivolous; or to tell you that amongſt the throng of Females <hi>Almeria</hi> was preſently noted for her which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Golden Apple, would bee as needleſs.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Amity</hi> is formed betwixt equalls, or equalizeth thoſe whom it unite's, there was no Body, how envious ſoever, that ſeeing <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Diſcourſing with <hi>Almeria,</hi> would not judge them the beſt Maach't Couple in the World, onely Hee appeared too white for a <hi>Man,</hi> and ſhee too brown for a <hi>Woman,</hi> but her brownneſs was Alablaſter in compariſon of the reſt. <hi>Piſides</hi> and <hi>Argal</hi> commended <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (who had given himſelf the Name of <hi>Iphis</hi>) for his choyce: But <hi>Pomeran,</hi> who alwayes ſuſpected this (ſeemingly feined) Love, conceiving that it had ſome reality which hee could not diſcern, had his mind balanced in the Flood and Ebb of different Imaginations; Sometimes reflecting upon the Reſemblance of the Picture <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had ſhewen him, hee thought ſhee might indeed bee <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> but that conjecture was ſoon effaced by ſome homely Actions, which <hi>Almeria</hi> counterfeited with ſo much Art, that the moſt cleer-ſighted would have taken them for Dame <hi>Nature's</hi> own production. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> raviſhed with delight to ſee his Deſign ſucceed, opened his Heart in private to <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated of his contentment to ſee how they were all deceived in <hi>Almeria,</hi> and ſhee her ſelf in him. And in regard the pleaſure would have been too ſhort, if confined to one daye's time, our Diſguiſed Gentlemen continued their Viſits to <hi>Almeria,</hi> and the reſt in <hi>Celian's</hi> Houſe for the ſpace of half a Moon: during which time the <hi>Palatine</hi> made a Report bee ſpread in <hi>Plocens</hi> (which was the chief City of his Government) that hee was retired to a <hi>Caſtellain's</hi> Houſe in the Country for ſome Affairs of great Importance.</p>
               <p>In the fifteen Dayes time which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with his Companions ſpent in a Rich Farmer's Houſe not far from <hi>Celian's,</hi> their Expences and great Cheer quickly made appear that they had nothing of Country-men but the Habit. They went not to Plough, nor followed any ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes as the others did, but making Fiſhing or Hunting their daily Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, they miſſed no opportunity of accoſting <hi>Almeria,</hi> either in the Groves, in the Meddowes, under the ſhade by the Rivers ſide, or neer ſome cool Spring. Theſe frequent Meetings confirming <hi>Merinda</hi> in the Opinion ſhee had that <hi>Almeria</hi> was a <hi>Maid,</hi> turned <hi>Belida</hi> and <hi>Remonda</hi> to their firſt belief. <hi>Lupicin</hi> with the four Concurrents loſt the ſuſpition they had that ſhee was a <hi>Man,</hi> to embrace this, <hi>That theſe Strangers were perchince The Men which had ſhipwracked her Honour in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51476:64"/> the City.</hi> Theſe ſurmiſes kindled their Fires, and their Fires redoubled their Jealouſies, ſeeing themſelves ſupplanted by perſons unknown. <hi>Envie,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe Man, is the <hi>vice</hi> of baſe abject Spirits. This Monſter whoſe Pain is another's Eaſe, and who feed's upon his own Heart, ſeated himſelf in the Souls of theſe Churles, who could not indure the luſter of ſo many gentile Qualities as rendred thoſe New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers recommendable. And as Wolves, (Creatures that are ſingular, inſociable, and which tear one another to pieces) do agree and go together, if there be queſtion of falling upon a Flock of Sheep, or breaking down a Fold; So thoſe Swains (who hated each other as Rivals) complotted with a ſecret intelligence how to chaſe away theſe ſtrangers from <hi>Almeria,</hi> and conſpired Machinations againſt her, which were the Effects of Hatred, though they proceeded from a contrary Cauſe.</p>
               <p>I omit their Reproaches and Detraction againſt her Innocency: For, their Jealouſie beeing viſible, our Gentlemen gave no credit to their Speeches, knowing that they troubled the pure <hi>Waters</hi> of that cleer <hi>Fountain,</hi> onely to hinder them from admiring and ſtaying neer it. It was a pleaſure to ſee the Schiſm that was amongſt them, and how their deceitfull Lips uttered words quite oppoſite to their Hearts; Some reported that <hi>Almeria</hi> was a <hi>Man,</hi> purſued by the <hi>Juſtice</hi> for a Murther, and had tranſveſted himſelf to avoid the puniſhment of his Crime; Others gave out that ſhee was really a <hi>Maid,</hi> but of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſhed and lewd Life, who to ſhun the fury of her Parents (that would have chaſtiſed her for her Fault) or to Live with more Liberty, had cloathed Herſelf in a Shepardeſſe's Weeds. One ſaid ſhee was a <hi>Citizen's</hi> Daughter, another that ſhee was born in the <hi>Country;</hi> ſome ſaid ſhee was of one Province, others of another; Some affirmed ſhee was <hi>Celian's</hi> Neece, others denyed it. If <hi>Remonda</hi> called her Couſin, <hi>Merinda</hi> declared ſhee knew her not; <hi>Belida</hi> gave her the ſtyle of Kinſwoman, <hi>Lupicin</hi> uſed another tearm; In ſumme, never a one could agree with his Companion, their Relations and Opinions beeing as differing as their Faces. You would have ſaid <hi>Almeria</hi> had been the <hi>Moon,</hi> for whom her <hi>Mother</hi> could not ſhape a Garment, becauſe ſhee was never long in the ſame condition. Theſe various rumours marvellouſly divided the Spirits of <hi>Argal,</hi> and <hi>Piſides;</hi> for, amongſt ſo many uncertainties they knew not what to apply their beliefs unto. Sometimes the <hi>Maſculine</hi> courage of <hi>Almeria,</hi> and her vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes made them incline to the thought of her beeing a <hi>Male</hi> Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51476:65"/> and when ſhee acted the <hi>Maid,</hi> the ſweetneſs of her Carriage perſwaded them the contrary. The brown tincture of her Complexion ſeemed to plead in favour of their former conjecture, but the Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and attractive Motion of her Eyes confirmed them in the later. However that her Education or Birth were of an Air which reſented nothing of Ruſticity, was evident: Inſomuch that they were really of the mind, <hi>that</hi> whileſt they thought to cheat her with their diſguiſes, ſhee laughed at their Artifices, and by a coun-termine would render all their Indeavours fruitleſs. Theſe imaginations they communicated to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who was ready to die with delight to ſee them ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly ſeduced. But <hi>Pomeran</hi> took no pleaſure in theſe paſſages; for, out of all theſe contrary Relations, Hee drew theſe Conſequences: <hi>If</hi> Almeria <hi>bee a</hi> Man, <hi>and what is worſe, a</hi> Murtherer, <hi>What honour is it for us to amuſe our Times about an Object, that one day upon a Gibet muſt make Faces at thoſe that paſs? Indeed wee are fallen into a rare conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of</hi> Clowns <hi>and</hi> Gallows-clappers; <hi>If ſhee bee a</hi> Woman, <hi>and of a looſe Life, what credit will it bee for</hi> Iphigenes <hi>to ſinge the Wings of his deſires at the Flame of ſo ſtinking a Torch? No, I cannot endure to ſee him caſt himſelf away in the Embraces of a diſſolute ſlut: But hee muſt firſt bee diverted by the ſweetneſs of the Rayes of ſolid</hi> Reaſons, <hi>and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the violent Buffets of ſtrong</hi> Remonſtrances; <hi>and before the light of his</hi> Judgement <hi>bee quite extinguiſhed, hee muſt be made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi> that <hi>hee is upon the Brink of a Precipice, whoſe fall is ſo ſteep, that if hee do but trip, he will never bee able to recover himſelf untill hee comes to the bottom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> rejoycing to ſee him ſo perfectly miſtaken, it cannot bee imagined what delight hee took in imparting theſe particulars to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria:</hi> And whileſt hee employed all his thoughts and time in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his <hi>Penelope,</hi> thoſe that accompanied him, ſeeing they could not make him hear of returning, fell a courting her Attendants; for, what elſe ſhould I call the two <hi>Sisters</hi> &amp; <hi>Belida,</hi> who were continually in <hi>Almeria's</hi> company? I ſhould bee too long if I ſhould relate in what manner thoſe ſubtile Wits inveagled the ſimplicity of thoſe ſilly <hi>Maulkins:</hi> for, to doubt of the advantages which the quaintneſs of <hi>Courtiers</hi> hath above the rude ignorance of <hi>Countrie</hi>-People, were to make a queſtion, when it is moſt light, at <hi>Noon</hi> or at <hi>Mid-night.</hi> They made ſuch fair Stories to thoſe dull <hi>Souls,</hi> that preſently they forgat the incertain Paſſion they had for <hi>Almeria,</hi> to frame new affections for theſe ſtrangers, who told them wonders of their <hi>Flocks,</hi> of their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51476:65"/> 
                  <hi>poſſeſſions,</hi> and of the commodities of their <hi>Village</hi> which they deſcribed to bee a <hi>Paradice</hi> on <hi>Earth;</hi> inſomuch that all three Siſters were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwaded to follow them, out of a certain inclination, (naturall to every Body) to ſeek that which is moſt advantageous. This bred ſtrange thoughts in <hi>Celian, Lupicin, Fleurial,</hi> and the reſt, ſeeing theſe unknown Perſons, and who had nothing of <hi>Peaſants</hi> but their out-ſide, ſhould breed alterations in the <hi>minds</hi> of thoſe, where they had lodged their <hi>Affections.</hi> Nevertheleſs (as all baſe and dull-ſpirited Souls are alwayes guilty of cowardize, what Anger ſoever their Malice is hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have not courage enough to produce any bold, or reſolute Effects) they quietly ſuffered themſelves to bee diſpoſſeſſed of their ordinary Converſations. And this ſupplantation was eaſie enough, for the <hi>Clowns</hi> beeing preſſed with Neceſſity, were more attentive at their Work and Profit, than their Pleaſure; whereas theſe <hi>Strangers,</hi> having nothing elſe to do, than to ſpin out their Time, and beſides, ſpending high, and making ſuch cheer as the others were not accuſtomed to ſee, might with much facility have advanced their Deſigns, if they had had any other than to give their <hi>minds</hi> ſome recreation.</p>
               <p>In mean time <hi>Iphigenes</hi> who deſired abſolutely to blot out of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria's</hi> Thoughts the Affection of <hi>Clemencia,</hi> and place himſelf in her room, in making himſelf bee cheriſht by his feined <hi>Mistris,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than a <hi>Friend,</hi> periſhed, like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> in preſence of his Remedy. Hundreds of times Hee was upon the nick of Declaring all the ſecret to this beloved Object; But <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> (without whoſe advice he did nothing of importance) ſerved as a Bridle to moderate the violence of his deſires, telling him, that <hi>the time of his Manifeſtation was not yet expired, and</hi> that <hi>hee muſt bee contented untill hee was Repealed from baniſhment, to the end his Marriage might bee in the eſtabliſhment of a</hi> Fortune <hi>more favourable for</hi> Liante. Who will now furniſh mee with tearms to expreſs Reſentments, which for their ſingularity, mee-think's, ought to bee remitted to Thought alone? When theſe two Friends could ſteal any time to themſelves, (for which they ſought all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible opportunities) It was a pleaſure to ſee the Admirations of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> who ſometimes thus entertained <hi>Iphigenes: My dear Brother, indeed it is not amiſs that our ſo paſſionate converſation is not in my Siſter's ſight, for, although it is but her Image, and the lines of ſome reſemblance of her which you love in mee, doubtleſs ſhee would find ſome cauſe to bee jealous of her Picture: I never ſaw you ſo fond of her, nor render ſuch endeering devoirs to the Originall. It is true, that therein you were to bee
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51476:66"/> Excuſed by reaſon of the tenderneſs of your Age, which did not make you Suſceptible of ſo great fire as you expreſs to mee, on purpoſe to deceive more neatly thoſe who do attend you. To deal really, were not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of our Sex incomparable, I could almoſt wiſh my ſelf as my Habit speak's mee, out of a conceit I have that you would love mee as well as my Siſter,</hi> and <hi>could I change my</hi> Nature, <hi>it ſhould bee meerly to bee your</hi> Wife, <hi>not to ſhare in thoſe Honours and Wealth which environ you, but for the Merits of your own Perſon, which are abundantly more Eſtimable than all the Benefits which blind</hi> Fortune <hi>diſtributeth ordinarily to thoſe that have no reall Deſert. Oh! why am not I</hi> Almeria <hi>indeed? and theſe feined Affections which you ſo dexterouſly do repreſent to mee, why are not they eſſentiall? Believe mee, after that, my</hi> Ambition <hi>would be at an end.</hi> Who can but think that this Diſcourſe deliciouſly flattered the imagination of <hi>Iphigenes?</hi> who to prolong that agreeable amuſement, and ſtill touch that String whoſe ſound was ſo Harmonious in his Ears, thus replyed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You may ſee,</hi> Brother, <hi>how far doth transport mee not the</hi> Love <hi>of an</hi> Image, <hi>as you imagine, but the power of my</hi> Friendſhip <hi>to you, I ſay to you, to your Perſon, to</hi> Liante <hi>as</hi> Liante, <hi>not as the Portraicture of</hi> Modeſtina: <hi>Indeed I love her, as my duty obligeth mee, but do not you know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo ill performed out of that Reſpect, as</hi> Loving, <hi>ſince that</hi> Paſſion, <hi>beeing the</hi> Daughter <hi>of our</hi> Will, <hi>retaineth ſomething of the</hi> Mother's <hi>Diſpoſition, whoſe Element, or rather Subſtance, is</hi> Freedome? <hi>But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conſtreint of a</hi> Matrimonall <hi>Bond, (which how golden ſoever it be, is alwayes a Bond) in my mind that</hi> Sex, <hi>in regard of it's frailty, is ſo little capable to ſuſtein that ſtreight and durable Knot of a true</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>that the greateſt inclination a Man can have for</hi> Women, <hi>is nothing in compariſon to that pure and cordiall Affection which hee bear's to a</hi> Friend, <hi>who is his ſecond ſelf. For, it is betwixt two equall</hi> Hearts <hi>that is formed that reciprocall correſpondence, wherein conſiſteth the Eſſence of</hi> Friendſhip. <hi>In that you apprehend to wiſh your ſelf of another Sex to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from mee a more ardent Affection, you have reaſon, conſidering, that were to wiſh a mighty inconvenience for a mean advantage: For, perchance if you were as your</hi> Siſter <hi>is, my Affection would bee much leſs fervent to you, for then I ſhould look upon you with more</hi> Compaſſion <hi>than</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>as a brittle Veſſell more worthy of</hi> Pitty <hi>than</hi> Envy. <hi>Yet if your</hi> Heart <hi>invite's you to deſire a condition ſo miſerable as that of</hi> Women (<hi>whom</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Nature <hi>have Created to bee ſubject unto</hi> Men) <hi>to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in mee an Affection which is already infinite; Give mee leave to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51476:66"/> anſwer your wiſh, who without Diſſimulation or Conſultation would, to the greateſt contentment of my</hi> Soul, <hi>relinquiſh not onely the favour of the</hi> Court, <hi>the dignity of my</hi> Palatinate, <hi>and the benefits I receive by the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the beſt and moſt liberall</hi> Prince <hi>in the World, (the</hi> King <hi>my</hi> Maſter) <hi>but all that I am, to purchaſe mee the power of beeing your</hi> Wife. <hi>It is I who am really jealous of</hi> Clemencia, <hi>and who would gladly have but ſo much priviledge of your thoughts as my</hi> Siſter, <hi>whoſe inconſtant</hi> Soul <hi>was ſo ſhaken with the wind of my</hi> Father's <hi>fury,</hi> that <hi>ſhee would have been perſwaded to marry</hi> Caſſin, <hi>had not the diſdain of ſeeing his</hi> Mother <hi>deſirous of my Bed, made him retire out of</hi> Podolia <hi>ſooner than</hi> Mieſlas <hi>expected. Oh fickle Girle!</hi> ſaid I, <hi>when I ſaw her ſo poor-ſpirited in an incounter, where ſhee needed but to have ſpoken boldy, and carved out a</hi> Negative. <hi>Oh wavering Girle,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>and unworthy of ſo perfect a Lover as</hi> Liante! <hi>had the</hi> Heavens <hi>put mee in thy place, I would ſurely have ſhewed more</hi> Fidelity <hi>and</hi> Reſolution: <hi>But what can bee expected from that</hi> Sex, <hi>but infirmities, ſince it is the pure ſubstance of Debility, and therefore alwayes ſhivering and moving like a Leaf? Yet what defects ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I do condemn in that</hi> Sex, <hi>I would not greatly care if I my ſelf were of it, if I thought thereby to be more your's, or</hi> that <hi>you would love mee as well as my</hi> Siſter.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Almeria</hi> taking the word out of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> mouth, ſaid; <hi>Believe mee,</hi> Brother, <hi>That if you love me as much or more than my</hi> Siſter (<hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I can hardly be perſwaded, knowing the little reaſon you have) it is the like with mee; and as if our Stars had Embraced at our Births (to Expreſs my Reſentments naturally, and nakedly to you) I never had by many degrees ſo much inclination for</hi> Clemencia <hi>as for you; and thereby I find that</hi> Friendſhip <hi>hath a more powerfull aſcendent over my Heart than</hi> Love, <hi>which, to ſay the Truth, is a</hi> Paſſion <hi>too Effeminate to have any regency in a Maſculine spirit. And to give you aſſurance that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments are reall, which make mee declare my ſelf in theſe Tearms, Hold for moſt certain that</hi> Clemencia <hi>ſhall never be any thing more to mee than what you pleaſe, and if you conceive that it may be for her advantage to Marry the</hi> Prince Caſſin, <hi>and mine to have another Wife, I will most freelie renounce all thoſe Pretentions, which your Perſwaſions induced me to have for her, my deſire ſubſcribing willingly to your command. Iphigenes</hi> ſeeing <hi>Almeria</hi> arrived at that Point, whereunto hee moſt paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to reduce her Reſolution, was ſtrongly tempted to diſcloſe the ſecret of his Birth; But, not having the conveniency to conſult his two <hi>Oracles,</hi> his <hi>Mother</hi> and his <hi>Governour,</hi> hee conteined himſelf,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51476:67"/> but with ſuch pain as may better bee imagined than diſcribed. So, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf to have abſolutely withdrawn <hi>Almeria's</hi> thoughts from <hi>Clemencia,</hi> which was the clog that moſt oppreſſed his Mind, and to have obtained her conſent to his <hi>Siſter's</hi> alliance with <hi>Caſſin,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to finde another Match that ſhould raiſe her Fortunes infinitely beyond what ſhee could have hoped by <hi>Clemencia; It is requiſite,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>to conceal your ſelf from thoſe whom my</hi> Father <hi>hath incharged to apprehend and carry you to him Alive or Dead, that you continue this Life, untill wee can finde the means to convey you into the</hi> Citty, <hi>or untill my Relegation beeing repealed, I may ſend for you to the</hi> Court, <hi>where by the</hi> King's <hi>Authority I doubt not but to ſecure you from the</hi> Tyranny <hi>of</hi> Mieſlas, <hi>and ſhall take order for the advancement of your Fortune. Mean time for our Recreations, let us perſiſt in dazling the Eyes of thoſe that are about us, as well your</hi> Ruſticks <hi>as my Attendants: Therefore the more ardour I ſhall expreſs to you, the more diſdainfully do you treat mee, the better to wipe out of their thoughts the ſinister Opinion, which they have conceived, that you are a</hi> Maid <hi>of an unchaſt Life. And to the end our Converſation may bee more frequent, I have an intention to put my ſelf likewiſe as a</hi> Servant <hi>to</hi> Celian, <hi>whom, I preſume, wee ſhall draw to any thing by the powder of Injection, wherewith wee will fill both his Hands and his Eyes; making him believe, that to avoid the rigour of our</hi> Parents, <hi>who would not conſent to the terminating of our Legitimate Affections by the ſacred tie of Matrimony, wee have been conſtreined to leave our Native</hi> Citty, <hi>and make uſe of this ſtratagem to meet and enjoy more freely each other's company, but with all the Civilitie, that can be expected from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which make profeſſion of</hi> Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almeria</hi> who was in the Hand of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as clay in the <hi>Potter's,</hi> condeſcended to whatſoever hee propounded; And in effect a Purſe full of <hi>Chekeens,</hi> or <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> had no ſooner made the <hi>Preface</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Speech to <hi>Celian,</hi> but hee believed the reſt as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> and with both hands preſſed it to a concluſion; And taking this occaſion as an occurrence of Treaſure, hee prayed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to diſpoſe of all that was within his ſmall power, as his own, and under the notion of <hi>Servant</hi> to command as <hi>Maſter.</hi> This did not diſpleaſe the old Man's Daughters, who were not ſo blockiſh as not to like the company of this new Gueſt; Onely <hi>Manile</hi> was ready to run beyond his Reaſon, proteſting with many Oathes to his Father to leave his Houſe if hee entertained that <hi>ſtranger. Celian</hi> to pacifie him, ſhewed him how hee was an enemy to his own good Fortune; telling him that thoſe <hi>Angells</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:51476:67"/> were not onely the <hi>Gardians,</hi> but the enrichers of his Family. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Hee, beeing deafned by <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> could give no eare, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued murmuring inceſſantly againſt his Father's covetouſneſs. Mean time <hi>Almeria</hi> to diſabuſe her two lately created Kinſ-women, tell's them another new forgery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>I came hither in</hi> Man's <hi>Habit, having made uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to withdraw my ſelf from under my Parent's Wings, not that I had made anie breach in my Honour, but fallen off from my Obedience to them. And I thought that their ſeveritie did furniſh me with a Sufficient diſpenſation: For, beeing deſired in Marriage by one</hi> Iphis, <hi>a Young Gentleman richer and of a better Extraction than I am, although contrary to the will of his friends, in whoſe Opinion I ſeemed too mean a Fortune for him, my Father not daring to promiſe mee to him without the conſent of his Father, whoſe power was redoubtable, wee deliberated, (to be free from that ſervitude) to betake our ſelves to the wide World; and therefore having put on Diſguiſes, to facilitate our Eſcapes, wee fled into theſe Woods, expecting untill Time, which bring's all things to perfection, ſhould diſpoſe our Parent's wills to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to our chaſte deſires. Thus in few words you have the Hiſtory of our Lives, wherein I ſee no other Crime than this ardent Affection which hath made us fall, not into any Diſhoneſty (for we deteſt Vice with horror) but into ſome ſort of Lightneſs &amp; immodeſty, which may eaſily be pardoned by them, who know to what Extrmities are tranſported thoſe that are touched, with the ſame Paſſion that animate's our Souls.</hi> This Diſcourſe ſhee made to <hi>Merinda, Remonda</hi> &amp; <hi>Belida</hi> which beeing ended, the two later looked as diſdainfully as their Paſſion could make them upon the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her of the falſe Accuſations ſhee had raiſed againſt <hi>Almeria's</hi> Honeſty; Whereupon <hi>Merinda</hi> very confuſedly, Anſwered, <hi>that Almeria had with ſo many different Stories overturned her belief, that indeed ſhee knew not how to truſt her, her former Lies prejudicing what Truths ſhee might afterwards deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To repreſent the divers Motions this laſt Invention caſt into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of theſe three <hi>Parcae,</hi> would require too much time: for, ſeeing their hopes nipped in the Bud, as well on <hi>Almeria's</hi> part (whom one while they thought to bee a <hi>Man</hi>) as on the other Stranger's, whom they imagined did keep them company onely to wait on <hi>Iphis,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, like the <hi>Parcae</hi> indeed, in the ſame concluſion, which was to cut the Thred of theſe ſtrange Practiſes, by hunting away thoſe unknown Perſons that diſturbed their repoſe. The ſame Deſign had <hi>Lupicin</hi> and his companions; But before they came to any violence, and to make
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51476:68"/> uſe of the <hi>Lion's</hi> skin, they were not ſo little politick as not to know that the <hi>Foxe's</hi> ought to bee employed firſt, having gained ſo much power over themſelves as to diſſemble what they thought. However they broke their minds to <hi>Celian,</hi> laying before his Eyes the many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, whereunto he expoſed himſelf by concealing in his Houſe perſons that were liable to the Law, and who durſt not ſhew their Heads for fear of the <hi>Juſtice:</hi> But, the vertue of that yellow metall (which is the meaſure of all things) had ſo ſtrongly operated in his brain, that he was incapable of any other reaſon, than that of his profit.</p>
               <p>In mean while the <hi>Time</hi> paſſed away ſo deliciouſly with <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who ſerving with a condition to do no Work, (which was likewiſe <hi>Almeria's</hi> Agreement) ſaw not onely every day, but every hour of the day, the beloved Object, which onely could comfort him, and yet which was the ſweet cauſe of all his diſquietneſs. Great was the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his Friends to ſee, that <hi>Paſſion</hi> had reduced him to ſo vile a Function; Eſpecially <hi>Pomeran</hi> was in an unſpeakable anguiſh for his Transfiguration, yet durſt not ſpeak much to him for fear of exaſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating his humour, knowing that fair perſwaſions would prevail much more upon his generous ſpirit, than the ſharpneſs of Reproaches. <hi>Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides</hi> were more moderate and complacent, making a favorable conſtruction of all his Actions, yet they could not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but reſent a little indignation to ſee him ſo Wedded to that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> in whom obſerving no ſuch exquiſite Beauty, they could not imagine whence ſhould proceed thoſe <hi>Charms</hi> that ſo ſtrongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and beſotted his <hi>Reaſon;</hi> then, condemning themſelves again of too much harſhneſs, they ſought Excuſes in the tenderneſs of their Affections to him, ſaying, <hi>This fantaſie will not laſt long, it is too violent, the neceſſitie of the affairs of his charge will ſhortly call him back to his Government; All theſe paſſages will quickly bee carried to the</hi> Court, <hi>and</hi> Shame <hi>will make him forſake this enterpriſe. The actions of great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, how ſecret ſoever they be, are at last divulged, ſuch publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can act nothing in private. Thoſe that are expoſed to the light of the Day, and to the view of the whole World, cannot remain long in obſcuritie. Mean time we muſt endure this ſtorm, and take our ſhare of this unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſtime; we would willingly follow the</hi> Palatine <hi>in ſome other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as more glorious, ſo more perillous; the worst that can befall in this, is but laughter; and beſides, the Paſſion which produceth theſe actions, carrieth it's excuſe in its blindneſs.</hi> Thus did the friends of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> diſcourſe amongſt themſelves, But Hee was like unto thoſe who having
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51476:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ulcers in their Bodies, do not apprehend any thing more than the hand of the Surgeon.</p>
               <p>Preſents, ſaith an Antient Writer, pacifie both the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> have a delight in receiving; Hee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Gifts, hath forged Chains to inthrall Hearts. The poor Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants have a cuſtome to bring petty Preſents to their Land-lords, either to preſerve or purchaſe their Favours; And our <hi>Ruſticks</hi> received Gifts from thoſe ſtrangers to let them live peaceably amongſt them. <hi>Celian</hi> was raviſhed, and thought it was <hi>Jupiter</hi> that was come to viſit his Houſe in a ſhowre of <hi>Gold,</hi> his Daughters were all repaired with the Favours <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and his Companions beſtowed on them; Not ſo much as <hi>Lupicin, Fleurial, Manile, Antalcas</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> but every one of them reſented the benefits of their Benevolence, beſides the good Cheer which they made every day at their charge, Wine beeing as plentifull with them as Water, and no ſpare made of delicate Diſhes. Theſe Exerciſes of the Teeth hindred for a while their Tongues from murmuring, and did make as it were a Dam to ſtop the torrent of their <hi>envy.</hi> Nothing was to be thought upon but Feaſts and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets after the Country faſhion, wherein <hi>Iphigenes</hi> made a great ſhew with a little Expence. Hee was preſently taken for a <hi>Grand Monſieur,</hi> and <hi>Almeria</hi> for ſome <hi>Lady</hi> of quality; And ſince hee was ſo willing to pay all, thoſe Trencher-Friends cared not greatly for working, every Day was <hi>Holy-day</hi> with them upon that account, and to keep <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> after the <hi>Boor's</hi> faſhion, is, not to labour at all, unleſs it bee with the Teeth and Gullet, Eating much and Drinking not a little; That done, Hunting, Fiſhing, walking amongſt the Groves, or repoſing upon the fragrant Banks of the Criſtall River, repeating Verſes, or making <hi>Eclogues</hi> upon the pleaſures of the <hi>Rurall</hi> Life, to the no leſs admiration of the ſilly Swains, than the ſatisfaction of the reſt, was their recreation for certain Dayes, which though then beeing at the longeſt of the Year, they thought the <hi>Sun</hi> did Gallop away too faſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphis</hi> during theſe Divertiſements having taken all occaſions to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the fervency of his Paſſion to <hi>Almeria,</hi> and ſhee as cunningly (according to their former Agreement) carrying her ſelf with much indifference towards him, ſo puzled the imaginations of the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, that it was hard to ſay which were moſt ſurprized, the <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> or the <hi>Courtiers:</hi> For, having remarked nothing in either of them of <hi>Ruſtick</hi> but their Habits, if thoſe did gueſs <hi>Iphis</hi> to bee ſome great
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51476:69"/> 
                  <hi>Man,</hi> theſe judged <hi>Almeria</hi> of an extraction far above that <hi>Vile</hi> (if I may not ſay) <hi>ſervile</hi> condition which ſhee had then embraced. Yet not remembring that ever <hi>Iphis</hi> had been ingaged in any <hi>Amoretta's</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi> nor at <hi>Plocens,</hi> nor in <hi>Podolia,</hi> they could not deviſe where hee ſhould have contracted ſo particular an acquaintance with <hi>Almeria,</hi> whoſe condition it was impoſſible they ſhould e're devine, having never ſeen <hi>Liante.</hi> And that which troubled them moſt of all, was to ſee that <hi>Iphis,</hi> who was far more beautifull than <hi>Almeria,</hi> had ſuch an extraordinary <hi>Paſſion</hi> for an <hi>Object</hi> that ſeemed not to anſwer his Flames, but with a kind of diſdain. But theſe <hi>Enigma's</hi> requiring a more ample Explanation, Night came on, which Eclipſing the <hi>Light</hi> of the Day, caſt them into a double <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> both of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>ignorance</hi> of a <hi>truth</hi> beeing no leſs an <hi>obſcurity</hi> to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> than the ſhade of <hi>Night</hi> is to the <hi>Corporall ſight,</hi> which depriveth it of its Function.</p>
               <p>The Night was differently ſpent by this diſguiſed Company: For, whileſt ſome troubled their Heads with projecting how to expound the Artificiall Demeanures of <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Almeria</hi> (which gave many ſtrange Alarms to their thoughts) Theſe did meditate new and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly-contrived Frauds, to render them blind at high Noon. Having then conferred in private (which conveniency they had by lodging in the ſame Houſe, though alwayes in the preſence of <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> whom <hi>Iphis</hi> might well call the <hi>Gardian</hi> of his Integrity) they determined to change their parts, and make the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> believe that <hi>Iphis</hi> was a <hi>Maid</hi> (which was but too true) and <hi>Almeria</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> (which was not falſe:) to which effect, <hi>that</hi> the next Morning ſtealing very early into the Woods, they ſhould change Habits, and put in Execution this Stratagem, as followeth. <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> conducter of the <hi>Bark</hi> having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Deſign (partly out of a deſire to ſee if his dear <hi>Nurſling</hi> could act the <hi>Woman's</hi> part ſo well, as ſhee had till then naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the perſonage of a <hi>Man</hi>) the performance was extreamly eaſie.</p>
               <p>Scarce had the cleer <hi>Aurora</hi> opened the grand <hi>Gates</hi> of the <hi>Orient,</hi> to give paſſage to <hi>Titan's</hi> Chariot, but our <hi>Diana</hi> and her <hi>Endymion</hi> loſt themſelves in the Foreſt. <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> onely (who upon the Sea of ſuch perilous occaſions never loſt the ſight of <hi>Iphis,</hi> no more than Marriners do the <hi>Pole</hi>) was Witneſs Complice of their Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragy. When the Brigade of the <hi>Feined</hi> as well as <hi>Reall</hi> Swains were aſſembled betimes, thinking to adviſe with the two <hi>Lovers</hi> wherewith
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51476:69"/> to deceive the houres of the following Day, the <hi>Gemini</hi> (the Starrs whereby they ſteered their courſe) appeared not; This was a foul ſtorm for them, and which ſtrook them with the fear of a Shipwrack. Every one thought diverſly, and ſpake according to his Fancy. One ſaid <hi>Almeria</hi> was not ſo rigorous as ſhee ſeemed, and <hi>that</hi> the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs ſhee ſhewed, was but a feined Copy of her Countenance. Another's Verdict was, <hi>that</hi> ſhee that would ſteal away from her Friends in that manner, would do worſe. A third Man alledged, <hi>that</hi> it was not likely that ſhee ſhould continue long without diſcovering what ſhee was, and <hi>that</hi> ſhee that could make a <hi>Pannier</hi> could make a <hi>Basket.</hi> Some made <hi>this</hi> conſtruction of their going away, ſome <hi>that. Proteus</hi> never aſſumed ſo many ſeverall ſhapes, as this abſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had Explications. <hi>Celian</hi> was very ſorry for the loſs of two ſuch profitable Gueſts, who were as the two Teats, from which his griping hunger of gaine found Suck in abundance. Hee ſtood amazed like a rich <hi>Miſer</hi> that hath loſt his Treaſure, hee grumbled and railed againſt his <hi>Children,</hi> for not keeping amity with thoſe goodly <hi>Angells,</hi> who would have put Wealth and Felicity in his Houſe. And alas! They were rather more perplext than Hee; For if <hi>Almeria</hi> had carried away with her the Hearts of all the <hi>Men, Iphis</hi> had gained no leſs ground in the Affections of his <hi>Daughters</hi> by his admirable <hi>Beauty</hi> and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Bounty.</hi> But the moſt aſtoniſhed of all were <hi>Pomeran, Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides,</hi> (for the reſt were at home;) To remaine any longer in that Ruſtick equipage, was quite againſt the hair with them, for, it was meerly the deſire of complying with the <hi>Palatine's</hi> humour, that brought them thither, and by his abſence that complacency fell to the Ground. They reſolved however to expect the return of <hi>Iphis</hi> for a while, conſidering they were not far from the City of <hi>Plocens,</hi> whither they could at all times make their retreat, if the too long want of his preſence ſhould drive them into impatience.</p>
               <p>The moſt amiable occupation of thoſe who have nothing to doe, beeing <hi>Hunting:</hi> They commanded the Country-men to follow them, having already given them to underſtand that they were <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of that <hi>Noble-man's</hi> retinue, whom they called <hi>Iphis.</hi> Gain and good Cheer (after which your <hi>Plough-Joggers</hi> will run and throng as thick as <hi>Flies</hi> in a <hi>Kitchin</hi>) were main Spurrs to prick on their Obſervance, for <hi>theſe</hi> they were their humble Servants, ready at the firſt call, (that ſort of People, although they were never ſo Lubberly and Heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, <hi>Gold</hi> will make them like quick Silver, and as nimble as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:51476:70"/> this <hi>Metall</hi> puts Wings to their Heels, and make's them skip like Squirrells.</p>
               <p>Whileſt they are going to their Stands, let us ſee what's become of our two <hi>Lovers,</hi> accompanied by the <hi>Moderator</hi> of their <hi>Paſſions.</hi> How joyfull were they to ſee themſelves rid of the peſterment of their Companions, whoſe too obſervant Eyes followed the motion of their leaſt actions? That moment of Liberty after ſuch painfull reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was no leſs agreeable to them than the pleaſure which a poor Priſoner feeleth, when his Irons are taken off. Beeing fallen upon the Diſcourſe of their feined <hi>Paſſions,</hi> they proteſted to each other, that thoſe Artificiall Expreſſions proceeded from a reall Reſentment; And that as the whole <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> could not produce an Example of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> comparable to their's; So, if there were a diſtinction of <hi>Sex,</hi> it would be the moſt perfect <hi>Love,</hi> and the happieſt <hi>Marriage</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi> Thence proceeding to the recitall of the handſom contrivance, and conduct of their <hi>Mummery</hi> (as one may call it) they were ready to ſplit with laughing to ſee that neither <hi>Iphis's</hi> Friends, nor the <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants</hi> knew what to think or ſay. Judge you what contentment the ſubtile <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> had in beholding thoſe two <hi>Hearts,</hi> ſo united by the Bond of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> that it ſeemed as if one <hi>Soul</hi> had animated both their <hi>Bodies;</hi> eſpecially when <hi>Almeria</hi> embracing <hi>Iphis</hi> with as much Simplicity as Tenderneſs, thus began; <hi>My dear</hi> Brother, <hi>Mee-think's thoſe Clowns were no Fooles, when they ſaid that thou hadſt the Beauty of an</hi> Angell; <hi>for, I believe, if thou wer't a</hi> Woman, <hi>all</hi> Men <hi>would fall in love with thee; As for my own particular all the</hi> Men, <hi>and all the</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>in the World are nothing to my Eyes, in compariſon of thee; the</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <hi>I bear to thee, (although limited within the bounds of</hi> Honour <hi>and</hi> Decencie) <hi>hath I know not what tender Reſentment, which I do not feel for all the reſt of my Friends.</hi> Pomeran, Argal <hi>and</hi> Piſides (<hi>to give them their due) are very gallant</hi> Men; <hi>but, to my ſenſe, they are no better than Statues to you; And yet it is not the greatneſs of your</hi> quality <hi>that dazleth my</hi> ſight, <hi>but the onely</hi> merit <hi>of your Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this endeering Language <hi>Iphis</hi> preſently replied, not without ſmiling upon <hi>Boleſlaüs; And I believe,</hi> Brother, <hi>that I have been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſame Dart for thee; for, all</hi> Women <hi>are ſo indifferent to mee when I am in thy Preſence, that me-think's there are none in the</hi> World; <hi>and this Name and this Diſguiſement of</hi> Almeria, <hi>ſtrike's ſo deep into my Imagination, that what thou thinkest I speak but in Jeaſt, is unfeinedly the production of my</hi> Soul's <hi>moſt tender thoughts: And if thou wert in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51476:70"/> Effect what thou art but in ſhew, I ſwear there is no Queen upon the</hi> Earth, <hi>whom I would have more willingly for my Wife than thy ſelf. I pre-thee,</hi> Brother, (<hi>anſwered</hi> Liante, <hi>do not talk to mee of beeing a</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>any further than in Habit; For, were it to make mee the</hi> Wife <hi>of the greatest of</hi> Monarchs, <hi>I would not bee of any other</hi> Sex <hi>than I am. But I'le aſſure thee,</hi> ſaid Iphis, <hi>that were it onely to bee Married to</hi> Liante, <hi>I ſhould be glad to be a</hi> Woman: <hi>And,</hi> that <hi>thou maiſt know with what ſincerity I ſpeak, if it be impoſſible for mee to be ſo, I promiſe thee, that I will loſe all the remainder of my Credit in the</hi> Court, <hi>or I will make thee Marry the most Eminent</hi> Lady <hi>in</hi> Polonia; <hi>And I am very certain,</hi> that <hi>it ſhall be meerly thy own fault, if thou failest of that fortune; For, the</hi> King <hi>cannot denie Mee that Grace, when</hi> I <hi>ſhall demand it in thy favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almeria,</hi> as if with the <hi>Woman's</hi> Habit ſhee had likewiſe put on the <hi>curioſity,</hi> was very importunate with <hi>Iphis</hi> to name that ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Party; that ſhee might diſpoſe her Courage to do ſome generous action, that might make her deſerve ſo high an Alliance. <hi>It is not yet time,</hi> anſwered <hi>Iphis, that I ſhould ſatisfie you therein;</hi> Wine, Love, <hi>and a</hi> Secret, <hi>if once vented, are worth nothing; you ſhall know it in it's ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Content your ſelf now to learn onely</hi> that <hi>to merit the Poſſeſſions of ſo rare a Subject, you ſhall not need to run any further dangers, than what you have alreadie undergone, and</hi> that <hi>it depend's intirely on my will: For, of the Perſon whom I mention I have the abſolute dispoſall; Almeria</hi> Smiling upon <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> whiſpered in his Eire, <hi>I know whom hee means, and what ſhee is; It is his Ward</hi> Eleonora, <hi>Daughter to</hi> Staniſlas, <hi>his Predeceſſor in the</hi> Palatine <hi>of</hi> Uratiſlau, <hi>but the fruit is not yet ripe, a great deal of</hi> Straw <hi>and much</hi> Time <hi>will be required to bring that</hi> Medlar <hi>to perfection. Boleſlaüs</hi> glad to ſee her in that pretty Error, told <hi>Iphis</hi> alowd what ſhee had ſaid, who was extreamly well pleaſed that ſhee underſtood it ſo, and to ſtick her deeper in her miſtake, <hi>The expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>will not be ſo long as you may imagine, I was not above two or three Years elder when I was Married to your Siſter: However, the party whom I intended for you is in Eſtate and all things elſe ſo far beyond</hi> Clemencia, <hi>who poſſeſſed your thoughts for a time,</hi> that <hi>when you ſee her you will not ſtand to conſult which choice you ſhould make.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Almeria</hi> caſting her ſelf amiably upon <hi>Iphis</hi> Neck, as the amorous <hi>Vine</hi> imbraceth it's Supporter, the <hi>Elm I pre-thee dear</hi> Brother, ſaid ſhee, <hi>ſpeak not to mee of any other Party than thy ſervice; for, as long as thou wilt own mee, I will never inſlave my ſelf to any</hi> Wife; <hi>or, rather, if you pleaſe, as long as you will permit mee to be your</hi> Servant.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51476:71"/> 
                  <hi>I will have no other</hi> Maſter; <hi>or elſe if you think fit to Honour mee ſtill with the ſtyle of your</hi> Miſtris, <hi>I will never have any other</hi> Servant. <hi>Iphis</hi> raviſhed to ſee her ſo perfectly deceived, would willingly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſome anſwer, but that <hi>Almeria</hi> held his Mouth ſo ſtraitly beſieged and blocked up with Kiſſes, that hee had not paſſage for one ſingle word, Onely their <hi>Tongues</hi> advancing to the Superficies of their <hi>Lips,</hi> made a mutuall communication of their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> ingendred ſuch <hi>Reſentments</hi> as tranſported them almoſt into that <hi>Extaſie</hi> which all <hi>Philoſophie</hi> holds for the moſt powerfull Effects of <hi>Love.</hi>

                  <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who feared leſt that <hi>Fire</hi> which quickneth when it is in mediocrity, and conſumeth when in Exceſs, ſhould bee kindled ſo fat in his <hi>Nurſling's</hi> veins, that afterwards it could hardly bee extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſeparate theſe <hi>Metalls,</hi> made uſe of the Water of <hi>Depart,</hi> that they might better practiſe thoſe Careſſes in their ſecond Tranſveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein <hi>Serife</hi> ſhould bee more favorable to <hi>Calliante,</hi> than <hi>Almeria</hi> had been to <hi>Iphis,</hi> which intimated <hi>that</hi> it was time for them to undreſs and change their Garments. <hi>Heavens:</hi> what do I ſay? Bee not diſturbed chaſt Souls, I will ſpeak nothing but what the moſt rigorous <hi>Vestal</hi> may hear without bluſhing, and without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of her <hi>Modeſty.</hi> Here it was that the naturall pudicity of <hi>Iphis</hi> acted its part, and that <hi>Almeria</hi> by her bold, not to ſay impudent, Actions did plainly ſhew what <hi>Shee</hi> was, by reaſon of her <hi>Sex,</hi> which rendreth <hi>Men</hi> leſſe baſhfull: For, as if <hi>Shee</hi> had had great haſte to become <hi>Man</hi> again, <hi>Shee</hi> preſently caſt off that ſhamefull habit, which belying <hi>Her ſpirit</hi> had violented <hi>Her Nature.</hi> Whereas <hi>Iphis</hi> could not put off <hi>His</hi> without much regret; for which purpoſe hee begged the protection of a thick copſe to hide the tumour of <hi>Her</hi> Breſts, which began to broach Treaſon againſt him. Whereupon <hi>Almeria</hi> in a jeſting manner ſaid, <hi>What?</hi> Servant <hi>do you hide your ſelf from mee, in a condition, wherein by your paſt ſighs you ſeemed to have lodged the chief of your felicity? See, how hee counterfeit's the</hi> Woman <hi>already. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee hath reaſon,</hi> ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>to give</hi> Iphis <hi>time to go away; for, it is more ſhamfull for a</hi> Man <hi>to take upon him a</hi> Woman's <hi>attire, than for you, who are a</hi> Man, <hi>to reſume your own</hi> naturall <hi>Habit.</hi>

               <p>It was in the time of the moſt exceſſive Heats, when the delightfull coldneſs of the Water is moſt deſired; So, there beeing not far off a <hi>River,</hi> which gently rowling its <hi>Chryſtall,</hi> or rather liquid <hi>Silver</hi> upon the <hi>Golden</hi> Sands, <hi>Almeria</hi> caſt her ſelf into it, carrying her Body as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51476:71"/> gracefully, and with as much eaſe along the ſtream, as a Swan doth ſeem to glide upon the face of a ſmooth Pond. <hi>Agreeable Water</hi> (ſaid ſhee waſhing her ſelf) <hi>purifie mee, I pray, from the Ordures I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted under a Habit, which hath ſullied the generoſity of my</hi> Sex: <hi>And ſince it was from your</hi> Element <hi>that the</hi> Goddeſs <hi>which cauſeth</hi> Love <hi>did receive her</hi> Beeing, <hi>make my excuſe to thoſe that ſhall reproach my</hi> Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, <hi>and tell them that this</hi> Paſſion <hi>is of ſuch a</hi> Nature, <hi>that as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth courage into the baſeſt ſpirits, So it make's guilty of unworthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoſe that before had never ſacrificed but to</hi> Glory, <hi>as the onely aim of of all generous</hi> Hearts. <hi>Let your Current,</hi> gentle River, <hi>carry all my follies into the boſome of the Sea, and drown in the depth of</hi> Oblivion <hi>the Name of</hi> Almeria, <hi>which I leave with her Garments.</hi> Whileſt ſhee was thus bathing her ſelf, and the water, which greedily environed her on all ſides, ſerved as a tranſparant veſtment, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> conveyed her clothes to <hi>Iphis,</hi> who could not bee ſo ſoon uncaſed for peeping at this <hi>ſwimmer</hi> through the boughes of the envious Trees, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee jealous of the attention of his Eyes upon that curious Spectacle.</p>
               <p>As hee was reveſting himſelf in <hi>Almeria's</hi> Robes, <hi>See Father</hi> (ſaid hee to <hi>Boleſlaüs) to what the vehemency of my</hi> Paſſion <hi>reduceth mee: For, without feining, whilest hee that is the Legitimate Object of my deſires is refreſhing himſelf in that Water, I conſume my ſelf in this Wood, which would likewiſe bee burned if it were ſuſceptible of my flames.</hi> Beeing by the help of <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> quite dreſt, <hi>Oh how handſome you are, my dear</hi> Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Daughter; (ſaid the old Man) <hi>The</hi> Goddeſs <hi>of</hi> Cyprus <hi>came not ſo beautifull out of</hi> Thetys <hi>Boſome, as you appear in this Equipage. If in the habit of a</hi> Man <hi>you did caſt ſo many fires amongst the</hi> Ladies <hi>at</hi> Court, <hi>with this you will ſet all</hi> Men, <hi>that look upon you, on fire: But bee wary, and keep your ſelf upon your guard, for, at this Game, oftentimes he that intend's to take, is taken.</hi> After this advertiſement hee went to carry <hi>Almeria</hi> the cloathes which <hi>Iphis</hi> had put off, which beeing of the Country-make, that is, not onely not fit, but a great deal bigger than needed, it was no hard buſineſs for our <hi>Maſculine Nymph</hi> to get them on.</p>
               <p>As the weary <hi>Pilgrim</hi> after a tedious travell rejoyceth at the review of his <hi>Native</hi> Soil; Such was the gladneſs of <hi>Liante</hi> to ſee himſelf again in his <hi>Naturall</hi> Garb.

Boleſlaus, <hi>I am not ſo eaſily deceived, Either I am no</hi> Man, <hi>or that is a perfect</hi> Woman; <hi>I will pawn my life that you have played mee ſome trick.

               <p>The newly transform'd <hi>Serife</hi> perceiving by theſe tranſported ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that her beauty had wrought ſtrange effects in the ſurpriſed <hi>Calliante,</hi> with a tone of Voyce that would have extracted the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of an affectionate reſentment from the moſt barbarous <hi>Soul,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>Really,</hi> Brother, <hi>You counterfeit the</hi> Lover <hi>ſo feelingly,</hi> that <hi>if you continue to act your part ſo handſomely, no creature will be able to judge but that indeed you are in</hi> Love, <hi>and this will bee the beſt means wee can have to uſher our Enterpriſe to the intended perfection.

I pray, eſteeme mee not of that rank, but believe that I am what I ſeem, and that what I ſay proceed's from the moſt Intire and tender reſentment of my Heart; For, although that</hi> Face <hi>and that</hi> Speech <hi>repreſent to my</hi> Eyes <hi>and</hi> Ears <hi>my dear</hi> Iphis, <hi>yet I am ſo taken with</hi> Serife, <hi>that if you change not that habit, I ſhall never change my</hi> Paſſion, <hi>and hence-forwards farewell the thoughts of any</hi> Woman: <hi>For, though I would rather that the</hi> Earth <hi>ſhould open under my Feet to ſwallow mee, than give that Crime admittance into my Breſt, which cannot bee imagined, much leſs named without horror; Yet I may ſay with much truth that my</hi> Soul <hi>is ſo glued (as it were) to yours, and your affection hath ſo penetrated my</hi> Heart, <hi>that I love you above the love of</hi> Women. <hi>This is to bee underſtood in the chaſteſt manner conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; For, without Honour and Vertue, no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Hearts can bear the ſacred name of</hi> Friendſhip: <hi>Otherwiſe, the Societies of Theeves and Infamous perſons would aſſume that glorious title; which would be too great a Profanation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Calliante</hi> took a way by himſelf, and <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> accompanyed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife</hi> a contrary, unto a Village not far from that where <hi>Celian</hi> lived; where leaving her, hee returned to ſeek <hi>Pomeran, Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides,</hi> where hee had left them; But hee found none but the three Siſters, <hi>Merinda, Belida</hi> and <hi>Remonda,</hi> who looked like Pictures that had loſt their Colour and Luſtre with the light: For, being deprived of <hi>Almeria,</hi> (who was their <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Splendour,</hi> though the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of their <hi>Envie</hi>) they were like Fiſhes upon the dry ground.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51476:73"/> Already <hi>Titan's</hi> panting Sleeds haſting to refreſh themſelves in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Waves, extended the ſhadow of the Mountains, when on a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a great noyſe and winding of Horns from the thickeſt part of the <hi>Foreſt</hi> peirced their Ears, intimating that a great Troop of Huntſ-men with a no ſmall pack of Hounds were making that way. Theſe were our diſguiſed <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and the perfect <hi>Clowns,</hi> which had met in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> with <hi>Iphigenes</hi>'s chief <hi>Ranger,</hi> who to keep his Horſes and his Hounds in breath had taken all the <hi>Palatines</hi> hunting Equipage to <hi>harbour</hi> a luſty <hi>Stag,</hi> which hee had <hi>imprimed</hi> there. But in regard this meeting was not unpleaſant, it will not bee impertinent to ſpend a little time in relating the manner.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Stag</hi> which bore all his <hi>rights,</hi> and whom Age had taught ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiles, made ſo many <hi>doublings</hi> or <hi>turnings,</hi> that hee put the ſubtleſt and beſt-ſented Hounds to a <hi>loſs;</hi> whileſt the nimble footed beaſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of their delayes, haſtned his Courſe towards a Pond, whoſe deſired Waters hee had no ſooner perceived, but hee plunged himſelf into the midſt, bathing his over-heated tongue in that refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquor, which hee ſeemed to ſuck all into his thirſty Throat, to quench the Fire that burned in his Stomack; ingaging his whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (covered with Sweat and Foam) ſo far in the Water, <hi>that</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared but his Head, couching his Horns upon his Back in the ſame manner as when hee uſed to ſwim. Our <hi>Clowns</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him, made him quickly leave that agreeable refreſhment, galling him with their Arrows; but the Wounds were ſo ſlight that they hindred not his Flight, which they were not able to follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo light-timbred as that ſwift <hi>Animal;</hi> and hearing on the other ſide by the retorting of the <hi>Eccho</hi>'s the confuſed noyle of the <hi>Huntſ-men,</hi> and the Cry of the <hi>Hounds,</hi> they reſolved to direct their ſteps that way, to inform the <hi>Huntſ-men</hi> of the fearfull <hi>Fugitive's</hi> retreat. And in effect they found them ſo puzled to finde out the cunning <hi>turnings,</hi> wherewith that ſubtle Beaſt had imbroyled his <hi>Strain,</hi> that without their directions the <hi>Chaſe</hi> had been at an end. But the pleaſure was to ſee the <hi>Huntſ-men</hi> take the <hi>Change</hi> as well as their <hi>Hounds:</hi> For, <hi>Pomeran, Piſides,</hi> and <hi>Argal</hi> being diſguiſed, and mingled without diſtinction with the <hi>Swains,</hi> they were not known by <hi>Arcade</hi> nor any of his Companions. So that paſſing all for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-fellows (the cuſtome of <hi>Prince's</hi> and <hi>Noble men's</hi> Huntſ-men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that <hi>Conntry,</hi> being to domineer over the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> and force them by menaces, rather than intreat them to bee aſſiſtant to them)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51476:74"/> 
                  <hi>Piſides</hi> and <hi>Argal,</hi> ſeeming to bee the nimbleſt and moſt dextrous of the <hi>Gang</hi> were commanded by the chief <hi>Huntſ-man</hi> to goe with them to the <hi>Pond,</hi> whence they had Chaſed the <hi>Stag,</hi> that by the <hi>Blood</hi> which their Arrows had drawn out of his ſides, the <hi>Dogs</hi> might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Sent.</hi> This made <hi>Pomeran</hi> ſay to his Comrades, laughing, what an Ancient <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaid of himſelf <hi>That they payed the Intereſt of their ill looks: Thou art miſtaken, anſwered</hi> Arcade, <hi>it is becauſe they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier men than thou, that I take them.</hi> Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Argal <hi>to the Hunt-ſman, if you ride very faſt wee ſhall not bee able to follow you, for wee are very unfit men to bee</hi> Lacquaies. <hi>Sirrah, ſaid</hi> Philaſter, <hi>I'le make thee finde thy feet, and if thou come'ſt not away quickly, I ſhall put mettle into thee.</hi> Hee had his Arm already up to meaſure <hi>Piſides</hi> o're the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who not being accuſtomed to ſuch careſſes, ſlipt aſide to avoid the blow, ſaying, <hi>You Master Huntſ-man, mee think's it would become you better to goe on Foot, and mee to Ride, if you would pleaſe to alight, wee ſhould end the</hi> Chaſe <hi>more conveniently.</hi> This hee ſaid thinking <hi>Philaſter</hi> would know him by his Voyce; But whether the heat of his <hi>Game,</hi> or the ſtrangeneſs of <hi>Piſide</hi>'s habit rendred him ſo little civile, hee replyed; <hi>How now</hi> Raſcall, <hi>doſt thou jeer mee? As I am a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, thou ſhalt pay for thy Inſolence.</hi> With that hee was going to joyn the Effect to his Promiſe, when <hi>Pomeran,</hi> calling him by his name, ſaid, <hi>Hold, art thou blinde? doſt thou not know</hi> Piſides <hi>under this</hi> Peaſant's <hi>Coat?</hi> Hee that meets a <hi>Ghoſt</hi> when hee thinks leaſt of it, is leſs Aſtoniſhed than <hi>Philaſter</hi> was, hearing thoſe words, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Error</hi> which hee was going to commit. So, leaping from his Horſe, and falling on his Knees, hee demanded pardon of him whom hee would have beaten, making many excuſes, accompanyed with Proteſtations, that were needleſs, ſince the diſguiſemement ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the offence nothing. <hi>Piſides</hi> and <hi>Argal</hi> turning all to laughter, took <hi>Philaſter</hi>'s Horſe and <hi>Armelin's; Arcade</hi> would have given <hi>Pomeran</hi> his, but being unwilling to diſmount the chief Conductor of the <hi>Game,</hi> hee took another. So, ſome running on Foot, ſome on Horſe-back, they continued their <hi>Chaſe.</hi> The Hounds having recovered the <hi>Sent,</hi> followed the <hi>Stag</hi> full-cry, untill being brought to the <hi>Bay,</hi> hee rendred his life with Tears, and lamentable Groans, to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the pitileſs <hi>Hounds,</hi> and the force of our <hi>Gentlemen</hi>'s Spears, who took pleaſure to pierce him in divers places. The <hi>Chaſe</hi> being thus ended, they ſatisfied the <hi>Huntſ-men</hi>'s admiration, by telling them that the <hi>Palatine</hi> was in that <hi>Foreſt,</hi> diſguiſed in the ſame manner for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51476:74"/> his divertiſement, incharging them not to ſay who they were, but only that they were <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of their acquaintance. Having thus given them their leſſon, they returned to <hi>Celian's</hi> Village, there to break up their prey, and make good cheer for their <hi>Country-men.</hi> Their arrivall comforted the old Man, who intended to kill the fat Calf if his <hi>Iphis</hi> had been returned: But his joy was very ſhort, when hee perceived not in all that company his deſired <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Almeria,</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their jonkets, hee could not bee merry, becauſe thoſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom hee loved more than his own Children did not appear. But <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> having given him ſome hopes of not beeing much longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their ſights, hee made of Neceſſity a Vertue.</p>
               <p>But it would bee hard to ſay whoſe aſtoniſhment was greateſt, that of <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> Seeing <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Servants and all his Hunting-Equipage; or their's to ſee <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> whom they knew to bee the inſeparable ſhadow of their <hi>Maſter's</hi> Body. However the diſcreet Old Man, knowing the <hi>Palatin's</hi> Intentions and moſt ſecret Thoughts, told them that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> would not bee well pleaſed to finde them there, where hee concealed himſelfe for ſome very important Affaires; therefore hee willed them to return next Morning betimes to <hi>Plocens.</hi> Which command they readily obeyed; For, hardly the Breaking <hi>Day</hi> had ſummoned the watchfull <hi>Stars</hi> to prepare themſelves for a retreat, but the <hi>Hunts-men</hi> (as early as the <hi>Precurſor</hi> of the <hi>Morn's</hi> approach) caſt themſelves again into the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> with deſign to coaſt over the Country, Hunting, to theirs <hi>Maſter's</hi> Houſe. But the adventure of their return deſerve's the time to conſider it.</p>
               <p>The Paſſionate <hi>Serife,</hi> whoſe ſenſes felt no ſmall commotions in <hi>Calliante's</hi> Preſence, had during the Night, and in his abſence loſt the benefit of repoſe; For, this <hi>Idea</hi> was ſo lively imprinted in her mind, <hi>that</hi> ſhee was continually in <hi>Alarme</hi> untill her ſight reſtored to her Eyes that malignly-ſweet conſolation, which is taken in the aſpect of the Object beloved (the ſource of perplexing Agonies no leſs dear than troubleſome.) Scarce had <hi>Aurora</hi> Guilded o're the Girdle of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> but leaping out of her Bed (which ſeem'd to her as if it had been ſtrewed with Thorns) ſhee went into the <hi>Wood</hi> to entertain her Thoughts; ſweet Thoughts, which hovering within the <hi>circumference</hi> of <hi>Love's</hi> Dominion ſtill lighted upon <hi>Calliante</hi> as their <hi>Center,</hi> her Deſignes ayming at nothing but to captivate that high <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe ambition could not bee limited by any leſs ſubject than her ſelf.

There, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of the ſhady Boughs (which were ſo interlaced, that the <hi>Sun</hi> could not peep through, but rather <hi>Night</hi> in <hi>Day-time</hi> ſeem'd there to keep her Reſidence) beeing laid along upon the ſoft <hi>Flowers,</hi> which loſt their luſtre at the preſence of thoſe that appeared in her <hi>Face,</hi> an humid coolneſs having ſent a ſweet vapour into her <hi>Eyes,</hi> uſhered in gentle SLEEP, who could not all Night upon the Feather-bed finde admittance. Scarce had that drowſie <hi>Deity</hi> benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all her ſenſes, but MORPHEUS (who take's delight in repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the imagination the moſt extravagant <hi>Chimera's</hi> that can bee fancied) made her conceit, that the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia</hi> diſpleaſed at his backwardneſs to ſatisfie her deſires, had made recourſe to the power of inchantments, which of an <hi>Iphigenes</hi> made a <hi>Stag,</hi> and that the ſame <hi>Stag</hi> thredding the bruſhy Woods, and having mued his <hi>Antlers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Hinde,</hi> which beeing purſued by the <hi>Palatin's</hi> Hounds and Men, was reduced to ſuch extremity, <hi>that</hi> if ſhee had not retaken her former ſhape, ſhee had been killed by theſe, and devoured by the others. Theſe troubleſome thoughts put her into ſtrange perplexities, and paſſing her <hi>Hand</hi> twice or thrice over her <hi>Face,</hi> as it were, to ſtrike off the Flies, ſhee felt a ſtinging more ſharp than thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's ordinary touch, which made her awake; and ſhee had no ſooner opened her Eyes, but the firſt <hi>species</hi> that formed it ſelf to her ſight, was an horrible <hi>Serpent</hi> of an immenſe growth, which made towards her, ſliding himſelf in divers folds upon the Graſs, infecting it with the poyſon which diſtilled from his ſwollen Throat. This ſpectacle made the valorous <hi>Serife</hi> finde her Feet; but in regard ſhee had long ſince forgot the Trade of running away, gracefully brandiſhing her <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe's</hi> hook, ſhee marched couragiouſly towards that furious <hi>Snake,</hi> which caſting fire out of his Eyes, and darting mortall poyſon from his pointed tongue, diſpoſed himſelf to give her a ſtrange exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. But ſhee, who feared neither <hi>Wolf</hi> nor <hi>Bear,</hi> and who not long before had laid a wild <hi>Sow</hi> grovelling upon the Earth, (not inferiour in bigneſs or ſtrength to the <hi>Erimanthian Bore</hi>) with three blows, addreſſed with an incredible dexterity, put this dangerous <hi>Serpent</hi> in a condition of defending rather than aſſaulting, and with two more
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51476:75"/> of flying rather than defending himſelf, beeing bruiſed in ſeverall places of the Body; But, knowing that if thoſe Creatures are not hurt in the <hi>Head,</hi> all other blowes are but of ſmall effect, ſeeing <hi>that</hi> hee trailed but lazily his weakened <hi>Train,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> hee hardly could finde out his retreate, ſhee hit him ſo full upon the Pate, that preſently hee remained without Motion. Then, ſhee bethought her ſelf that this might bee the <hi>Event</hi> of her <hi>Dream,</hi> although the <hi>ſpecies</hi> were as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as <hi>Ridles</hi> are from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> which is commonly applied to them: But not beeing able to imagine, who had ſo opportunely waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, ſhee believed it might happily have been her good <hi>Angell</hi> (to whoſe guard (as wee read) wee are committed) they having charge to preſerve us in all our wayes, to uphold us leſt wee ſhould ſtumble, and to give us the courage to trample upon <hi>Serpents,</hi> and the moſt fell Animals of the Earth. With this thought lifting up her Eyes to the azury roof of <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſhee addreſſed this</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hileſt ſhee was in theſe <hi>Divine</hi> Meditations, a little Golden Feathered Bird ſeemed to warble and chant in her ſhrill Notes, Actions of grace to the <hi>Authour</hi> of all Good, for giving that <hi>Virgin</hi> the power to kill the Serpent, according to the threat pronounced againſt that curſed <hi>Creature</hi> at the firſt <hi>Creation.</hi> This pretty Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony made <hi>Serife</hi> caſt her Eyes to the place, whence her Ears received the ſound, and having a while obſerved that this little Bird fluttering from Branch to Branch did follow her, as if it ſang the IO POEAN of her Victory, Shee was amazed at laſt to ſee it caſt it ſelf with fury upon the Body of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> pecking him as if it would have killed him again after Death. Which recalled to her
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51476:76"/> memory a Relation ſhee formerly had heard of a ſmall Bird called <hi>Saura,</hi> which is held to bee as great a Lover of <hi>Man-kind</hi> as a Hater of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and whoſe naturall cuſtome is to peck the Faces of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſleep in Medowes or Marſhy places, as well to kiſs them as to make them waken to avoid the Ambuſhes and biting of <hi>Serpents,</hi> that lie ſculking under the Graſs. Hence ſhee conjectured that thoſe prickings which ſhe had felt upon her Cheeks, ſleeping, proceeded from the <hi>Philanthropie</hi> of that little Creature, which had the care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her from the deadly ſting of that reptile Enemy, who would have conveyed <hi>Death</hi> with his <hi>Poyſon</hi> into her <hi>Heart.</hi> But all this had little congruity with the <hi>ſpecies</hi> which her Dream (though ſhort and ſodainly interrupted) had ſo lively ingraven in her fancy. <hi>O Serife,</hi> juſtly you begin to act the <hi>Woman,</hi> wherein <hi>Women</hi> moſt play the <hi>Women,</hi> that is, by the obſervation of Dreams.</p>
               <p>As the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> dimmeth that of a Torch or Candle, ſo a great noiſe drowneth one which is leſs loud; <hi>That</hi> of a <hi>Chace</hi> with a full Cry and vehement impetuoſity, baniſhed from the Ears of our contemplative Shepheardeſs, that <hi>Bird's</hi> chirping, the murmure of the gliding <hi>Water,</hi> and the whiſtling of the <hi>Wind</hi> amongſt the Trees. Theſe were her own Huntſ-men, who returning to <hi>Plocens</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of their Blood-hound had rowſed an Hinde, and looſed the whole Kennell after her. The Foreſt returned <hi>Ecchoes</hi> from every part, and this beeing an exerciſe wherein <hi>Serife</hi> took a ſingular delight, her former thoughts raviſhed with this preſent Object, were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turned towards that part, whence ſhee heard that confuſed noiſe (which is more agreeable to thoſe that love that ſport, than the moſt melodious harmony, that <hi>Muſick</hi> can produce in its beſt regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Concerts;) and taking a croſs path, in ſhort time ſhee arrived at the Game. <hi>Heavens!</hi> how was ſhee ſurpriſed with aſtoniſhment, when ſhee ſaw her own Hounds (whom ſhee knew ſeverally by Name) and her own Servants, who were far enough from thinking her to bee their <hi>Maſter.</hi> Shee remained ſome while in ſuſpenſe whether ſhee had beſt appear, or retire into the thickeſt of the Wood to avoid their ſight, leſt they coming to know her, might found ſome Opinions which might bee prejudiciall to her afterwards. But whether the exceſſive Pleaſure ſhee took in this <hi>Cynthian</hi> Recreation, hindered her from retreating; or whether ſhee thought, at the worſt, if ſhee were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>that</hi> ſhee ſhould eaſily turn into a laughter, the changing of her Habit, ſhee reſolved to ſhew her ſelf, and the firſt Man ſhee met ſhee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51476:77"/> asked him what was their Game; <hi>That</hi> accent, <hi>that</hi> manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that</hi> grave and <hi>Majeſtick</hi> port, <hi>that</hi> Angelicall Face, and <hi>that</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate complexion, touched the Hountſ-man ſo, that hee ſtood ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill as if hee had been at a <hi>loſs;</hi> and conſidering with Attention this <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> hee thought hee had met <hi>Diana,</hi> or one of her <hi>Nymphs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this confuſion, hardly knowing what to anſwer, hee ſaid, <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Nymph, <hi>wee are in chace of an</hi> Hinde, <hi>which wee have ſingled out from the</hi> Herd; <hi>but if this Company hath made us take the</hi> Change, <hi>your preſence is more capable of ſtaying us: For, there's not one of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but would become your ſervant as well as I, if hee had been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to meet you.</hi> Sir, <hi>replyed</hi> Serife, <hi>I am not ſo lately come into theſe Woods, but that I know the cuſtome you</hi> Hunters <hi>have to abuſe all the</hi> Shepherdeſſes <hi>you finde, and then at your return make your</hi> City-Dames (<hi>whoſe ſlaves you are) merry at their ſimplicity; But wee are not yet ſo dull, but that wee can diſcern your craft, and know that under the Hony which is upon your</hi> Lips, <hi>you hide the Gall which you carry in your</hi> Hearts.</p>
               <p>This anſwer retorted no leſs gracefully than wittily, ſeized <hi>Armelin</hi> (ſo was the Hunts-man called) with a new aſtoniſhment; Inſomuch that falling further into diſcourſe with this agreeable <hi>Nymph,</hi> hee indeavoured by a multitude of deep proteſtations to aſſure her, <hi>that</hi> ſhee had conquered him in a moment, and <hi>that</hi> hee never had felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf taken with ſo violent a Paſſion, nor farther remote from diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for any Creature in the World. But as hee made ſhew of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting from his Horſe to talk with her more at eaſe, and by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to render her more ſuſceptible of his torment: <hi>Know, ſaid</hi> Serife, <hi>that although wee come ſhort of your</hi> City-Dames <hi>in</hi> Beauty, <hi>wee doe exceed them in</hi> Honeſty, <hi>and that our Ruſtick</hi> Simplicity <hi>render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us leſs capable of beeing ſurprized by your deceitfull and affected</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; <hi>Go,</hi> Sir, <hi>keep on your way, I'le follow your Game with my Eyes, and although your little courteſie refuſeth to inform mee what it is, I am not ſo ignorant in this exerciſe, but that I may teach you; and if I can come time enough to the fall of your</hi> Deer, (<hi>ſo that you vouchſafe to lend mee your Sword) you ſhall finde that I know how to uſe it aſwell as my</hi> Hook <hi>or</hi> Diſtaffe. This ſaid, ſhee preſently retired into the thickeſt of the Wood, leaving poor <hi>Armelin</hi> perplexed with ſtrange imaginations; One while, hee thought it was an <hi>Angell</hi> that vaniſhed as ſoon as it appeared; For, <hi>that</hi> Voyce, <hi>that</hi> Garb, <hi>thoſe</hi> Eyes, and <hi>that</hi> manner of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51476:77"/> Speech, ſeemed to have hee knew not what of <hi>Celeſtiall.</hi> At laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it was an illuſion which had charmed his Senſes, ſhaking off his amazement, hee ſet Spurs and haſted after his Companions. Having overtook them, hee prayed them to give him audience a little while, and having told them in few words, how hee had hapned upon the moſt beautifull, not onely <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> but <hi>Creature</hi> that his Eyes ever had beheld, who wandring all alone might perchance bee brought to yeeld, not to their <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> but to the <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> of the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which by his Deſcription hee kind led in their <hi>Souls;</hi> They like Hare-brain'd <hi>Hunters</hi> and diſſolute <hi>Courtiers,</hi> who at the firſt motion do burn with a baſe deſire of evill-doing, preſſed him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to conduct them towards that cleer <hi>ſpring,</hi> there to quench the <hi>thirſt</hi> of their abominable <hi>Luſts.</hi> Their Requeſt was no ſooner made, but granted: So true it is <hi>that</hi> vice is alwayes leading to a Precipice, and <hi>that</hi> illicite Paſſions may not improperly bee compared to Bitches, which bring forth their young ones blinde, all firſt motions beeing without conſideration.</p>
               <p>They ruſhing through the Wood thitherwards, where <hi>Armelin</hi> met <hi>Serife,</hi> had not gone far before they eſpied her advancing a great pace in a path, which ſhee thought would lead her to the Game. They preſently rode up to her, and <hi>Arcade</hi> and <hi>Philaſter</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's</hi> words were very much inferiour to the merit and Graces of that <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> they thought this <hi>Prize,</hi> better worth than the <hi>Hinde</hi> which they were purſuing. Mean time the Hounds, which were no more incouraged nor cryed after, left their <hi>chace</hi> to follow their <hi>Maſters,</hi> inſomuch that they were environed with the whole <hi>Pack</hi> when they accoſted <hi>Serife,</hi> who ſeeing her ſelf bayed and barked at by thoſe Creatures, began to fear that her <hi>dream</hi> might indeed then turn to truth; For, all the three Gallants beeing equally inamored of her Beauty, quitted their Horſes with a reſolution to have, by faire means or by foul, that which could not enter into the thought of any but perſons whoſe brutall Pleaſure is the onely Butt of their Paſſions. They began with Compliments, from thence they paſſed to inſolent Language, and from inſolent words to impudent Actions. <hi>Serife</hi> at firſt took much pleaſure to ſee her own Domeſticks in that pleaſant errour, and by witty and ambiguous anſwers did ſeem to whet their Deſires and quicken their Inventions. But at laſt when Impatience made them ſpeak openly, and gave them the impudence to come to threats of Force, this extremity made her take off her Mask, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51476:78"/> caſting her hand upon the guard of <hi>Arcade's</hi> Sword, ſhee drew it haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying to them, with a tone and Countenance full of diſpleaſure; <hi>How,</hi> Philaſter, Arcade <hi>and</hi> Armelin, <hi>are you ſo doubly blinded,</hi> that <hi>you know not</hi> Iphigenes <hi>your</hi> Maſter? <hi>and admit it were not</hi> hee <hi>that ſpeak's to you under the Habit of a</hi> Shepherdeſs, <hi>ought not you to dread his Anger and his Justice, if it ſhould come to his knowledge that you ſhould have committed in the meaneſt ſubject of his</hi> Palatinate, <hi>an act ſo diſhonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a</hi> Rape?</p>
               <p>When they heard their own Names from the Mouth of a Perſon, to whom, they thought, they had not been known, and that the word of <hi>Maſter</hi> piercing their Ears, made the Scales fall from their Eyes, to know the <hi>Palatine</hi> under an habit ſo unſuitable to his quality; if the <hi>Earth</hi> had opened under their Feet, or ſome mighty <hi>Tree</hi> falling had ſqueezed their Bodies under it, I believe they would have thought it an happineſs to have periſhed at that inſtant, rather than have ſwallowed the Shame and Confuſion that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed their Hearts and covered their Faces with the Livery of Guilt. They remained for ſome time ſo immoveable, <hi>that</hi> they reſembled Statues, rather than living perſons. And when this amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had given them leiſure to breath, they did like People that are drowning, who catch not at that which may beſt help them out of danger, but that which come's firſt to their hands. <hi>A free accuſation is alwayes better than an impertinent defence.</hi> Therefore they did like the <hi>Crocadile,</hi> which weepeth and yet hath no tongue; tears were the diſcourſe of their Repentance, and ſighs and ſobs the witneſſes of their reall Reſentments, which begat in the Heart of that generous <hi>Amazon</hi> a greater deſire to pardon than to puniſh them, though they would have endured the chaſtiſement with as much conſtancy, as they had little confidence to demand forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>This perſecution was no ſooner ended, but there began another, no leſs perilous. For, the Hounds beeing inraged for loſing the ſent and footing of their Prey, falling foule upon one another began a furious skirmiſh, wherein <hi>Serife,</hi> who loved them paſſionately (as the cuſtome is of great perſons who take delight in Hunting) ingaging her ſelf to ſeparate them, beeing preſſed with fury and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Blood, they turned their rage againſt her, and had it not been for the Sword which ſhe had naked in her hand, they would have preyed upon her. Shee called them by their ſeverall names, that they might the better know her, but their Barking and Yelping quite
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51476:78"/> drowned the ſound of the Shepherdeſſe's voyce; the more the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beat them, the more eager they were to faſten on her. Thus <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife,</hi> for having ſeen with too much curioſity her <hi>Diana (Almeria</hi> or <hi>Calliante</hi>) bathing in that Silver ſtream, had like to have undergone the miſerable <hi>Acteon</hi>'s fate: And her Dream was accompliſhed in ſuch manner, <hi>that</hi> whereas other Dreams are but the repreſentations of precedent Events, in this, there ſeemed to bee denoted ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Traces of ſucceeding accidents. Wherefore <hi>Serife</hi> taking by the fore-top this Occaſion, which preſented it ſelf, of making uſe of her own Servants to effect her preſent deſigne, commanded <hi>Philaſter</hi> and <hi>Armelin</hi> to repair without delay to <hi>Plocens</hi> with their Hounds, and not to hunt any more in that Foreſt without her order, palliating the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſement of her perſon, and her change of habit with the pretence of affairs, highly concerning the ſervice of her <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country:</hi> But the ſecrets of <hi>State</hi> which ſhe then attended, were only thoſe of her <hi>Paſſion;</hi> Her <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Calliante,</hi> in reſpect the <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>Queen</hi> of the Faculties of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> Shee kept <hi>Arcade</hi> to wait on her, having ſent the others away one on Horſeback, the other on Foot making uſe of <hi>Armelin's</hi> Horſe for the purpoſe which you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>Whileſt they return to the City with the Seal of Silence upon their lips, (applyed by <hi>Serife's</hi> command) being reſolved to bee more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and reſerved for the future; let us ſee what was the iſsue of our newly-tranſveſted <hi>Lover</hi>'s deſigne. <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> like a craftie <hi>Sinon,</hi> had already (according to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> intention) prepared the Spirits of <hi>Pomeran, Argal</hi> and <hi>Piſides</hi> to a belief, that the <hi>Palatine</hi> had enjoyed <hi>Almeria</hi> long before hee left the <hi>Court,</hi> though with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, that the watchfulleſt obſerver could never diſcover his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; ſo that living ſecretly like a <hi>Paris</hi> with that <hi>Hellen,</hi> hee ſeemed in the Eyes of the World to bee another <hi>Hyppolitus;</hi> And that retiring from the <hi>Court</hi> unto his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> Hee had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to wear a <hi>Shepherdeſſe</hi>'s weeds, that hee might viſit her as a <hi>Nymph</hi> of thoſe Woods: Unto which Motion ſhee (who was a piece of Wax in his Hands) eaſily conſented, burning with reciprocall ardors for the incomparable <hi>Iphis,</hi> though in appearance ſhee ſeemed to bee all Ice. This artificiall Fiction (whereof they had already ſome conjectures, eſpecially ſince their ſtealing away in that manner) ſo balanced thoſe Gentlemen's imaginations, that it preſently paſſed with them for a certainty, and thereupon by a complacency (ſo ordinary amongſt <hi>Courtiers</hi>) they determined to favour thoſe amorous ſtealths,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51476:79"/> like him who is reported to have ſlept at a Feſtivall meeting purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give another the opportunity to Court a <hi>Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this ſurmiſe <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> made them reſolve to expect the loſt Couple's return, which was with a very handſome heat. For, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> who was become <hi>Calliante,</hi> having changed in ſome town thereabouts his Contrie-ſlops for a Gentleman's apparell, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed himſelf with a Horſe, came upon the Spur to <hi>Celian</hi>'s houſe, and making a ſhew of much earneſtneſs and indignation, inquired of the good Man for a Siſter of his, called <hi>Almirea,</hi> who, hee ſaid, had been ſeduced by a Young man, named <hi>Iphites,</hi> threatning to make both of them feel the Bloody effects of his juſt diſpleaſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge by their deaths the diſhonour which through his <hi>Siſter</hi>'s Folly redounded to their Family. <hi>Celian</hi> ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe, and judging by the perfect reſemblance of this Gentleman's face to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria</hi>'s, that indeed hee might bee her Brother, durſt not at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what hee knew of her; but making uſe of her abſence, <hi>I know not</hi> (anſwered hee) <hi>where ſhee is whom you demand, neither can I give you any account of her.</hi> Hereupon came forth the diſguiſed <hi>Courtiers,</hi> the reall <hi>Rusticks</hi> and <hi>Celian's</hi> Daughters, who all together environed the <hi>Stranger,</hi> and conſidering him with attention, they concluded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently that hee was <hi>Almeria</hi>'s Brother. <hi>Calliante</hi> vapouring and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing thundered out a thouſand <hi>Rodomontadoes,</hi> ſaying, That <hi>he muſt and would have them reſtore her, whom hee charged them with concealing in that Houſe; alleaging that in the neighboring Hamlets hee had learned ſuch certaine Intelligence thereof, that hee could not bee otherwiſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Then, falling to the relation of ſome particulars, and telling them that his Siſter called her ſelf <hi>Almeria</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Almirea,</hi> and that <hi>Iphites</hi> had given himſelf the name of <hi>Iphis,</hi> hee put all the company into a ſtrange plunge, and their anſwers were as different as their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>The three Siſters, being as envious as incapable of keeping a Secret, declared without much intreaty what they knew of her; which was in part confirmed by the Swains: But <hi>Iphis</hi>'s friends thinking to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the <hi>Palatine,</hi> denyed all that the others affirmed, being induced thereunto by <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who was ready to dye with delight to ſee this pleaſant contradiction. <hi>Calliante</hi> feigning not to know <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelf to thoſe who told him news of the Fugitives, and, as if hee had had a Commſſion to be a ſelf-murtherer, hee drew his Rapier, after ſeverall Exclamations, ſeeming to deſire nothing more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51476:79"/> in the world, than to ſheath that blade in the bowells of the loſt <hi>Almeria.</hi> This confirmed the Ruſticks in their ſuſpitions of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria</hi>'s honeſty, and made them paſs for a Cauſe adjudged the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and privacies which they had obſerved betwixt her and <hi>Iphis.</hi> In ſumm, having ſaid all they knew and thought of her, the concluſion was, that <hi>Calliante</hi> found nothing but the neſt, the Birds had taken their Flight, and perchance upon inkling of his arrivall. But <hi>Pomeran</hi> being curious to dive ſomewhat deeper into the knowledg of this affection, prayed the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to inform him <hi>how</hi> it came to paſs, that his Siſter <hi>left</hi> her friends in that manner, <hi>where</hi> the place of her Birth was, and <hi>what</hi> the name of their Family. <hi>Calliante,</hi> who deſired nothing ſo much as this demand, to have a Subject whereon to eſtabliſh his Deceipt in the mindes of thoſe Gentlemen alſo, deſired to bee excuſed, ſaying, <hi>That the recitall of that Story would but tear up his wound again, and aggravate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair by the manifeſtation of his diſhonour.</hi> This refuſall ſharpned the deſires of the hearers, who joyned all together in a ſupplication to him, to ſatisfie their curioſity therein, promiſing to aſſiſt him in the ſearch of that abuſed Damſell; and they preſsed him ſo far, <hi>that,</hi> as yeelding to their intreaty, not without much unwillingneſs, Hee thus began.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> In the Plain of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> not far from a place where the River <hi>Nidas</hi> loſeth its name in the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> ſtandeth a very agreeable City named <hi>Corcin,</hi> wherein was the Manſion-houſe of my deceaſed Father; there exchanging <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Heaven,</hi> hee left my Mother a Widow, with a charge of two Male Children, and as many Females. I was born a Twin with a Siſter, who hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been taken for mee, and I for her; when the tenderneſs of our Age rendred us incapable of diſcerning our Sexes, without which our Nurſes (as I have been told) were oftentimes like to have exchanged us, being unable to diſtinguiſh us by our Faces. If you have ſeen the unfortunate <hi>Almirea</hi> here, I believe you will judge by my <hi>Gate,</hi> my <hi>Pitch,</hi> my <hi>Voice,</hi> and my <hi>Countenance,</hi> that I ſay nothing that can bee contradicted by your experiences; and if the habit which I wear did not make appear what I am, you would take mee for a diſguiſed <hi>Damſell,</hi> or a <hi>Man</hi> tranſveſted. And I remember, whileſt the innocence of our Age permitted us thoſe ſports which are agreeable to Children, that wee did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take pleaſure in changing our Cloathes, to make us bee taken
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51476:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> one for the other, and ſo deceive in merriment all thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with us. Inſomuch that in our neighbourhood, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that either <hi>Calliante</hi> was <hi>Almirea,</hi> or <hi>Almirea Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the rude <hi>Manile</hi> (according to the cuſtome of Country-lobs, which is to interrupt them that ſpeak, without any reſpect or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) ſaid, <hi>In good ſooth,</hi> Gentleman, <hi>You did well to aviſe us of that, for if you had not, there's none of all this Company but would have tane you for the ſame</hi> Almeria, <hi>that hath put ſo many Doubts, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Paſſions and Proclamations in our Heads. It may bee ſhee bewitched him that follow's her, and who, you think, hath raviſhed her; for in the few dayes ſhee was here, ſhee bred</hi> (I can tell you) <hi>ſtrange ravages, or rages (what you will call 'em) in our Spirits. I marvell why you will take ſuch pains to ſeek after a Creature, whoſe loſs is as advantageous, as the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dammageable.</hi> The reſt of his Gang nodding their Heads approved <hi>Manile's</hi> reaſon, and not one of them but ſaid in his Heart, <hi>that</hi> it was a faire riddance of her, and <hi>that</hi> the Gentleman was like thoſe that are jealous, who are very eager to finde out what were far better let alone.</p>
               <p>After this interruption, <hi>Calliante</hi> continued his relation in this manner. <q>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that you may know mee for other then that idle <hi>Run-away</hi> (the reproach of our Blood and the ſhame of our Extraction) you muſt underſtand, <hi>that</hi> being in the Country with my Mother in a Caſtle of her's not far from the place of the <hi>King</hi>'s reſidence in Summer time, and neer a Foreſt where their Majeſties uſe ſometimes to recreate themſelves with the pleaſure of Hunting, It hapned one day (for our ſorrow) that one of the greateſt men of this Kingdome, being ſtrayed in the Foreſt and overtaken by Night, which robb'd him of the knowledg of the way to return to the <hi>Citty,</hi> where the <hi>Court</hi> was, retired himſelf to our Houſe; where holding his arrivall for a great Honour, wee received him with the greateſt reſpect and Courteſie wee could imagine, little thinking that hee ſhould have been like that <hi>Machine</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> which ſet on Fire that famous <hi>City,</hi> whoſe Story hath employed ſo many Pens. But this falſe <hi>Courtier</hi> having caſt the Eyes of Concupiſcence upon the unfortunate <hi>Almirea,</hi> and finding perchance ſome reciprocall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in that language of looks, which cannot bee underſtood but by thoſe that love; That encouraged him to ſpeak in generall tearms; thence to fall into Courtſhip and expreſſions of Affection,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51476:80"/> and ſo by little and little into private Familiarities, which ſeduced the ſimple Girl into her perdition, being overcome with the glory of his Greatneſs, and egged on with that vanity, which is ſo naturall to that Sex, to ſee themſelves Sued to, and Adored like <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> which openeth the dores of their Hearts to that Paſſion, whereof if but one ſparkle taketh in ſuch weak Subjects, it preſently flames like Fire in dry ſtraw or Flax, and cannot bee quenched neither by Tears nor Blood. His viſits following (&amp; ſomewhat too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iterated) were the <hi>Match</hi> by whoſe Smoak wee eaſily diſcovered the <hi>Fire;</hi> But to oppoſe great perſons and Favorites, or, like the <hi>Gyants</hi> in the Fable, if by heaping Hills on Hills you offer to wage War againſt thoſe <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſo firmly ſeated on the top of <hi>Fortune</hi>'s wheel, they will but laugh at your contradictions, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did at the ridiculous indeavours of the <hi>Pigmies.</hi> Although wee viſibly ſaw that the deſign of this <hi>Polyphemus</hi> was to devour the Honour of our Family in abuſing my Siſter, yet it ſeemed that our low ſpiritedneſs ſtretched out the neck to this blow, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Yoke; thus Servile is the condition of thoſe who ſuffer their <hi>Honour</hi> to periſh to preſerve or advance their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> as if a <hi>Fortune</hi> were eſtimable without being <hi>Honourable.</hi> It is no ordinary diſpleaſure to mee to reveal this ſhame, which I ſhould rather ſtudy to conceale, every one naturally abhorring Infamy; but what? this is a thing ſo publickly known already, that if you ſhould not learn it from my Mouth, the very ſtones. would declare it to you, the whole World being full of it, by reaſon of the abuſe of my Siſter, and the greatneſs of him that hath made the unworthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of her. But if I had watched ſo carefully, as I might have done, the deportments of my Siſter, or that my Mother had had her Eyes open upon the golden Apple of her Integrity, wee never had felt thoſe ſad effects of ſorrow which now afflict us: For, the pudicity of Virgins is like a Glaſs, which may bee preſerved a long time if well looked unto, but with the leaſt knock is broken all in pieces. Yet ſince faults are perſonall, why ſhould I derive the vices of the Guilty upon the Innocent? Eſpecially in regard the <hi>Honour</hi> of that Sex cannot be garded by any but themſelves; for, the too ſtrict obſervation of others in this caſe doth rather irritate than appeaſe their Paſſions, and ſharpen rather, or Set, than take off the edge of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. No Demonſtrations, no Admonitions were wanting on our parts, to diſſwade that inconſiderate Girle from the converſation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51476:81"/> of that, no leſs dangerous than deſirable, Viſitant; intimating to her that although his frequent coming were without any evill effect, yet ſhee could not admit of his company without Suſpition and Scandall, in regard the Actions of great Men, eſpecially <hi>Favorites,</hi> were Subject to a thouſand interpretations, whereof the moſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter were generally the moſt Certain. Sometimes, when my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked her what fruit ſhee could pretend of that, but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Affection, unleſs it were the loſs of time, and perchance of her Honour, (which is commonly attended by a publick ſhame and an univerſall table-talk, which hurrieth into the precipice of deſpair thoſe that expoſe themſelves to ſuch miſeries:) Shee, belying her own Heart, would anſwer, that ſhee believed <hi>Iph</hi>' (excuſe mee, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if his name who ought to bee odious to mee, beeing at my Tongue's end, had like to have broke through my Lips, ſince out of the abundance of the <hi>Heart</hi> the <hi>Mouth</hi> ſpeaketh with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation) ſhee anſwered, I ſay, that ſhee thought that <hi>Nobleman</hi> had no more deſign upon her, than ſhee had inclination for him; <hi>That</hi> ſhe took all his diſcourſe and compliments but as eſſayes of his abundant wit, or tricks of Affectation which the <hi>Court-Gallants</hi> hold for commendable qualities; and <hi>that</hi> all his expreſſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding only from the out-ſide of his Lips, penetrated no farther than the <hi>Superficies</hi> of her <hi>Ears,</hi> preſerving her heart clear from the contagion of that venimous <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which moſt perſons do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, but few eſchew. But not to weary you with too tedious a relation, notwithſtanding his Scorpion-like ſubtilty to hide the Poiſon of his Intentions, &amp; her ſimplicity, too ingenious for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the <hi>End,</hi> which uſeth to Crown good Actions with Glory, diſcovered to us the ignominy of their evill practiſes, as you ſhall hear. When this great <hi>Favorite,</hi> being fallen into ſome diſgrace at <hi>Court,</hi> was in a manner exiled to his own <hi>Palatinate;</hi> at this departure, their two <hi>Hearts,</hi> whoſe Bodies had perchance contracted another alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than that of <hi>words,</hi> could not ſupport their <hi>diſ-union:</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that by the <hi>King</hi>'s command hee beeing enforced to leave the agreeable Climate of the <hi>Court,</hi> it was no difficult matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the imprudent <hi>Almeria</hi> to tranſveſt her ſelf and follow him, judging that in that habit every one would take her for mee. Shee preſently condeſcended to this propoſition, which, as it was the <hi>Life</hi> of her <hi>deſire,</hi> proved the <hi>Death</hi> of her <hi>reputation.</hi> So, taking a Suit of mine of Sea-green, layed with Silver-lace, and having handſomely
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51476:81"/> put up her Hair, under a Grey Hat, covered with a White Plume, ſhee Mounted one of my beſt Horſes; and in the Dusk of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning repaired to the place where her <hi>Paramour</hi> had aſſigned her: ſince which time I could never learn any certainty what was become of her, untill <hi>Fame</hi> (the inſeparable ſhadow of great Perſons Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,) informed us that this <hi>Nobleman</hi> being come into his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was no where leſs than in the <hi>City</hi> of his Reſidence, but conſumed all his time in Hunting amongſt theſe Woods, where hee was become a Prey to a <hi>Shepherdeſs</hi> of ſuch beauty, that bred Envy in all thoſe <hi>Ladies</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> whoſe Affections hee had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed formerly. Hereupon a thouſand imaginations aroſe in my troubled Mind, ſometimes, <hi>that</hi> hee had left my Siſter incloſed in ſome Caſtle as a Trophy to his Vanity, contemning her with as much Cruelty after abuſing her, as hee had ſeduced her with Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Sometimes, my Fancy ſeemed to perſwade mee, <hi>that</hi> ſhee, who denying her Sex, had had the Courage to Diſguiſe her ſelf in <hi>Man</hi>'s Cloathes to follow him, might well renounce that condition, and take upon her the habit of a <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> thereby to enjoy his converſation with leſs Suſpition and more Liberty. At length, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my own Curioſity, and my Mother's deſires, reſolving to ſearch out my Criminalls, <hi>Fortune</hi> conducted mee into theſe parts, where I am incouraged with ſome hope of finding what I ſeek: And now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I muſt conjure your Courteſie, by all that I read of Humane in your Faces, and doe believe to bee in your Hearts, to Favour mee in this ſo juſt a Cauſe, which I have ſo ingenuouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto you, to the end this Freeneſs of mine, joyned to the Generoſity which is ſo naturall to all Perſons of Honour, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you to afford me your aſſiſtance. For, not to conceal the leaſt point of Truth from you, I am reſolved in this buſineſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not only mine, but the Honour of my Family, to play Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Quit, or to ſtake all I have, and (like the Bee which puts her life in her revenge, leaving her Sting in the Wound ſhee makes,) ceaſe to live after the loſs of my Honour; for, to injoy Life without Honour, I'eſteem a condition farworſe than a thouſand Deaths. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I finde aſſuredly that my Siſter hath paſſed beyond the bounds of her <hi>Duty,</hi> and preferred her <hi>Pleaſure</hi> before her <hi>Reputation,</hi> my reſolution is by plunging this Poniard into her Boſome to tear that polluted Soul out of her unchaſte Body; if otherwiſe, I will preſs the concluſion of her Marriage as much as I can, and decency will
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51476:82"/> permit. For, if <hi>Love</hi> equalizeth <hi>Lovers, Honour</hi> doth render the Condition of <hi>Gentlemen</hi> equall to the greateſt <hi>Nobles;</hi> and my Extraction is not ſo obſcure, but that I can reckon divers <hi>Palatines</hi> of my Anceſtors, in whoſe Dignities, though I have not had the fortune to ſucceed, I ceaſe not however to inherit a part of their Courage; Beſides, I want neither Friends nor Kindred, who eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my Intereſts, will joyn their Arms with mine in this juſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: And; <hi>ſince hee is Maſter of another's Life, who deſpiſeth his own,</hi> there is no ſort of hazard, whereinto I ſhall ſtick to precipitate my ſelf to get ſatisfaction from that <hi>Raviſher</hi> of <hi>Almirea,</hi> how great ſoe're hee bee, beeing perſwaded by this Maxime, <hi>That hee dyeth gloriouſly, who periſheth with his adverſary in the reſentment of an injury.</hi> Nevertheleſs not to run head-long, or like one that's blind, I will firſt bee ſatisfied of the truth, and then I ſhall ſee how to ſettle my Reſolution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calliante</hi> filed theſe and diverſe other particulars on the thred of his <hi>Narration</hi> with ſuch Art, pronounced them with an Air and Accent ſo full of grace, and animated his Speech with Actions (though fein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) which ſeemed ſo reall, that <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who knew all the myſterie, could not ſufficiently admire his induſtry, that could ſo dexterouſly put a Mask upon his Tongue, which at the ſame inſtant deceived the Eyes, Ears, and Thoughts of all that were preſent, who though appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as you know) to bee all of one condition by their Habits, were of two ſorts extreamly different, yet equally deluded by the ſubtilty of <hi>Calliante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwers which hee received from theſe Auditors were very different, or rather contrary; For, the <hi>Peaſants</hi> (through a vice which is ordinary to them) beeing extreamly jealous of <hi>Iphis,</hi> thought they had met with a fair opportunity to ſatisfie their malicious humor and deſtroy him, by declaring to the ſtranger that <hi>Almirea</hi> (who was in a <hi>Shepherdeſſe's</hi> habit, and called her ſelf <hi>Almeria</hi>) was not onely in love with <hi>Iphis,</hi> but had loſt her ſelf in his embraces, which (they ſaid) was manifeſt enough by their running away together. This Depoſition was ſtrengthened by the teſtimony of the Shepherdeſſes, who hating <hi>Almeria</hi> no leſs than they loved <hi>Iphis,</hi> endeavored all they could, not to wound, but rend in pieces the Reputation of her, who raviſhed them, whileſt they thought her of a Sex contrary to her habit. But the diſguiſed <hi>Gentlemen's</hi> Anſwer was quite otherwiſe; For, <hi>Pomeran</hi> ſpeaking for them all, and ſhewing himſelf full of zeal for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51476:82"/> of <hi>Iphis,</hi> having boldly denied all that the malice of thoſe baſe <hi>Souls</hi> had calumniouſly alleged, aſſured <hi>Calliante,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> his Siſter was ſo curious of preſerving her integrity, that her Suitor had nothing ſo ordinary in his Mouth as the Complaints of her Severity (which <hi>Lovers</hi> are accuſtomed to qualifie with the titles of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi>) which the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> could not gainſay without doing an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable injury to the truth; therefore hee exhorted him not to give credit to their <hi>Envy,</hi> but rather to believe the Report of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as they were, (though covered with habits diſproportioned to their Conditions) than to the viperous Tongues of thoſe <hi>Clowns,</hi> who carried the venim of <hi>Aſps</hi> upon their Lips, and who ſpake onely by conjecture; But if Hee would not conform his <hi>Paſſion</hi> to the Rule of their <hi>Reaſons,</hi> they had <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and knew how to rule his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> oppoſing with <hi>Force</hi> the <hi>Violence</hi> which hee threatned in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; Hee, whom hee was to incounter, (beſides his quality and perſonall valour, which had rendered him victorious over ſo many redoubtable Enemies) not beeing ſo unprovided of Servants, nor fallen ſo in diſgrace with <hi>Fortune,</hi> but that hee could yet command a great number of gallant Men, who would take glory in hazarding their Lives in his Defence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomeran</hi> had continued to urge this Point, and doubtleſs had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <hi>Calliante</hi> in a ſingle combate (wherein hee would have wanted no ſeconds;) But that the cunning <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> traverſing this Diſcourſe interrupted him, telling him in his Ear, <hi>that Iphis</hi> would bee very much diſpleaſed, if hee ſhould pick a quarrell with <hi>Calliante,</hi> whom hee indeavored by all means poſſible to oblige, thereby to render his Siſter more tractable; <hi>That</hi> all things beeing fairly carried, and the honour of <hi>Almeria</hi> no wayes intereſſed, there was nothing ſo eaſie as to terminate that difference in an amiable manner, without fighting upon ſuch <hi>punctilio's</hi> of words, Menaces beeing but vain flaſhes, or like blaſts of Wind which leave no trace behind them: <hi>that</hi> it would bee much better to follow this way of gentleneſs, than to repulſe juſt Reſentments with impertinent <hi>Bravadoes: that</hi> from this claſhing, as from the colliſion of flints, nothing could proceed but ſparks, which would produce veryd angerous flames: Beſides; to his knowledge, <hi>Iphis</hi> would not bee well contented, that the Peaſants ſhould penetrate ſo far into his ſecrets, as to know his Affection and Quality, or the Condition of <hi>Almeria: that Calliante</hi> had already ſpoken but too much, unleſs hee ſhould have quite diſcovered the <hi>Mine,</hi> which would
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51476:83"/> ſpoil all the ſport, wherein they ſaw the <hi>Palatine</hi> did take an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent recreation, which diverted him from melancholly for his diſgrace and abſence from the <hi>Court. Pomeran</hi> reliſhed theſe reaſons, which beeing communicated to <hi>Piſides</hi> and <hi>Argal,</hi> they became like Men without the faculty of Hearing and Speaking; <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> aſſuring them <hi>thát</hi> in ſo doing they would oblige and render moſt agreeable Service to <hi>Iphis,</hi> of whoſe pleaſure, hee told them, hee had certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as alſo of the place of his retreat, which was not very far from thence.</p>
               <p>Mean time, <hi>Calliante</hi> having thus contrived his Deſigne, the better to bring it to effect, addreſſed his Complaints to the <hi>Countrey-men,</hi> who promiſed him Miracles, induced as well by their own baſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as with the hope of profit, which the <hi>Gentleman</hi> made glitter in large promiſes to them. Already they ingaged themſelves to put into his Hands thoſe whom hee was ſeeking, wherein they diſcovered no leſs temerity than baſeneſs, obliging themſelves to effectuate that which was neither within their Knowledge, nor Power. <hi>Calliante</hi> being tranſported with joy to ſee them ſo perfectly deceived, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Promiſes, and incouraged them to aſſiſt him with Propoſitions of conſiderable recompences. Hereupon they went to offer Sacrifices to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> I mean, to make good cheer, at <hi>Calliante's</hi> charge; For, it is the cuſtom of thoſe Ruſticks to ſeal all their Bargains with Diſhes and Bottles, otherwiſe they hold no Agreement can bee firm or proſperous. On the other ſide, <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who had the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, promiſed his Companions to bring them the next Day to the place where the <hi>Lovers</hi> were, which was ſo ſtrong, that being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might laugh at the folly of thoſe Clowns, and at the vanity of <hi>Calliante,</hi> who after the Faſhion of great perſons had made choice of the worſt ſide, that is, of Flatterers.</p>
               <p>Scarce had the cool <hi>Aurora</hi> powred out thoſe drops of dew, which look like liquid Pearls, or little Eyes, upon the Graſſe's tops, when both the <hi>Crues</hi> went forth to ſeek what they ſhould never finde in the manner they did imagine, although they ſhould have compaſſed the whole Earth and ſea; Whileſt the <hi>Countrey-men</hi> conducted <hi>Calliante</hi> in his <hi>Knight</hi>-errantry, entertaining him with <hi>ſmoaky</hi> promiſes, as hee fed them with the <hi>Vapors</hi> of <hi>Hope, Boleſlaüs</hi> knowing the <hi>Blank,</hi> was ſure not to miſs his <hi>aym:</hi> For, <hi>Serife</hi> having aſſigned him the <hi>Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> in a certain by place in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> after a long wandring, this politick Guide feining to have miſtaken his way (although hee had
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51476:83"/> on purpoſe brought them inſenſibly out of all beaten Paths) when they were all at a ſtand, not knowing whither to direct their courſe, the found of a plaintive voyce ſaluted their Ears; Which ſtruck them into a ſodain amazement, and made them the more aſtoniſhed, the leſs they imagined to finde any reaſonable Creatures in ſo wild a Place; the Deſire of beeing put again into ſome way, added to the curioſity, which is ſo naturall to humane Spirits, of knowing other's miſeries, made them advance towards the place, whence the <hi>Air</hi> conveyed thoſe ſad Accents to their hearing: For, whether <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> had made any ſign, or whether they had been deſcried a far off by any one that was ſet <hi>Sentinell</hi> to that purpoſe, juſt as they arrived, a deep-fetch'd ſigh broke the way to theſe Expreſſions.</p>

               <p>A heavy groan having terminated theſe words, there was not one of the Hearers (excepting <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who was acquainted with the Plot) but thought it had been <hi>Almeria</hi> that charged <hi>Iphis</hi> with perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, ſeeing her ſelf forſaken, like another <hi>Ariadne</hi> by <hi>Theſeus,</hi> after the loſs of her <hi>Honour.</hi> As they were upon the point of ruſhing in to ſhew themſelves, and conſolate the Affliction of that Deſolate Plaintif, <hi>For Heaven's ſake Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>do not appear before this Creature, untill I have diſcovered what ſhee is: For, mee-think's I have heard this voyce heretofore, and I am certain it is not</hi> Almeria's, <hi>beeing too much aſſured of</hi> Iphis <hi>Love to her, and that his Deportments beeing full of honour, Hee is no Man to commit ſo unworthy an Action.</hi> So, having perſwaded them to ſtand ſtill in a place where they could not bee perceived, the old <hi>Fox</hi> ſlipped gently into the Thicket, as if hee went to diſcover who that dolefull Female was, who (as if ſhee had been advertiſed of the approach of thoſe that heard her) thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her Complaints.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Deplorable <hi>Modeſta,</hi> what Fruits haſt thou of thy <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> ſince thou haſt ſowed on a barren Sand, and ſince thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Affections have not been able to oblige the moſt inconſtant of all Humans, to keep what hee had ſo often ſworn to thee? Indeed thou hadſt reaſon to believe that hee would play thee ſuch a trick, conſidering without caring to deliver thee out of the Priſon, where the rigot of thy Father-in-Law had incloſed thy innocence, hee ſlighted thy Diſaſters, and laughed at thy Tears and Captivity. Yet if hee had forſaken mee for that <hi>Princeſs,</hi> or thoſe great <hi>Court-Ladies</hi> which were ſo paſſionately taken with him, it would bee ſome conſolation in my incomparable Misfortunes, to ſee my ſelf ſupplanted by thoſe that exceed mee in Deſerts, as far as I have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed in Affection to him all thoſe of my Sex; But, to violate his Faith promiſed to mee, for a <hi>Country-Hoiden,</hi> for a <hi>Herd-Wench,</hi> who is as inferior to mee in <hi>Birth, Eſtate, Breeding</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> as I am to thoſe Starrs which render ſo illuſtrious the <hi>Court</hi> of our <hi>Monarch,</hi> that is a thing which I cannot endure without an Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking anguiſh, more ſenſible and dolorous than a thouſand Deaths. Therefore ſince I cannot ſurvive an affront of ſuch indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, I am reſolved to die; but it muſt bee in the preſence of him whoſe inconſtancy doth murther me, that in expiring I may faſten to the coller of that ingratefull <hi>Wretch</hi> a thouſand <hi>Furies,</hi> which may repreſent inceſſantly to his thoughts my Bloudy <hi>Ghost,</hi> to the end
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51476:84"/> that poſſeſſed with <hi>Despair</hi> for having reduced mee to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, hee may exerciſe a vengeance upon himſelf more horrid than can enter into my imagination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſobs breaking off her Speech, our hearers conjectured, and ſaid amongſt themſelves, that it was not <hi>Almeria;</hi> And in regard none of the other three had ever ſeen <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> they could hardly think that it was ſhee, becauſe they heard her call herſelf <hi>Modeſta</hi> (which Name pleaſed her the more, becauſe <hi>Iphigenes</hi> did commonly uſe it in his moſt Familiar careſſes to her.) Whileſt they were in this perplexity, returned the old <hi>Oedipus,</hi> who in ſtead of explaining this <hi>Enigma,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it more obſcure. For, counterfeiting much trouble in his <hi>Mind,</hi> with a low and trembling voyce hee ſaid to them; Gentlemen, <hi>let us bee gone from hence, or wee are all undone; for my part I think</hi> that <hi>this is an inchanted</hi> Foreſt, <hi>and that all the Adventures wee meet with proceed from</hi> Magick Art, <hi>And</hi> that <hi>the Enviers of the</hi> Palatine's <hi>fortune keep him here by witch-craft, and us with him. For, how can any Man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine without a manifeſt illuſion, that</hi> Modeſtina, <hi>my</hi> Maſter's <hi>Wife, ſhould bee transported into this</hi> Foreſt (<hi>without the help of ſome that deale with the</hi> Divell) <hi>to come to utter her Complaints in this Deſart corner, which hath no Inhabitants but ill-boding</hi> Schreech-Owls, <hi>and ſeemeth onely fit for a</hi> Sabat <hi>or Aſſembly of</hi> Sorcerers? <hi>And what know I but that Deſpair (wherewith her complaints do ſpeak her over whelmed) hath driven her to make recourſe unto this horrible remedy, to releaſe her</hi> Body <hi>out of Priſon, and free her</hi> Mind <hi>from the rage of her</hi> Jealouſie? Thereupon hee told them, that it was, indeed, <hi>Modestina</hi> lying at the foot of a great Tree upon a <hi>Carpet</hi> of <hi>Moſs,</hi> who made the Woods ſo reſound with the <hi>Eccho's</hi> of her lamentable ſighs; <hi>that</hi> if ſhe perceived him, he was a loſt Man, becauſe ſhee would believe that hee had ſeduced her Husband to thoſe Levities, or at leaſt fomented them by his Aſſiſtance, conjuring them to retire themſelves ſpeedily from that place; or (if their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity invited them to hear any further) to permit him to flie, that hee might not appear before the face of his <hi>Miſtris,</hi> tranſported with <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Grief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This amazement was ſo dexterouſly feined, and this adviſe colored with ſuch probability, that it ſerved as a Faſcination to the three <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's</hi> Eyes, and a Charm to their Ears, So really they believed this falſe Report. And whileſt they were conſulting whether they ſhould ſuccor that diſtreſſed Lady, or not diſcover themſelves to her, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> ſtill urged them to retreat, but in ſuch a manner, as rather increaſed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51476:85"/> their deſire of aſſiſting her. At length, <hi>Pomeran,</hi> who had alwayes pleaded <hi>Modestina's</hi> cauſe without knowing her (when he indeavored to divert <hi>Iphis</hi> from the purſuit of <hi>Almeria</hi>) judging beſides the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs hee ſhould have to bee known to her, hee ſhould begin his acquaintance by the moſt ſignall ſervice he could render her, remitting her into her Husband's Arms, made his Companions reſolve to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the <hi>Lady,</hi> (which <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> deſired moſt, yet ſeemed to fear) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them (the paſſion which poſſeſſed <hi>Iphis</hi> for <hi>Almeria</hi> proceeding but from a light youthly humor, and rather from <hi>Fancy</hi> than <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or a Diſeaſe in the <hi>Mind</hi> than any ſound <hi>judgement</hi>) that hee would thank them in the end for that which perchance at firſt would ſeem diſpleaſant to him, like thoſe who revile the <hi>Surgeon</hi> which hurteth them in dreſſing their wounds, and afterwards return him thanks, with a good recompence, when the Cure is done.</p>
               <p>Upon this Reſolution they all concluded to make <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> ſtay to bee witneſs of their proceedings, and that by his means they might the better bee made known to the <hi>Lady.</hi> But hee feined to ſtrive to get from them, the more earneſt they were to hold him. This Conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not bee without ſome buſtling, neither was the buſtling without ſome Voice and Murmure. At which a Man came ruſling out of the Thicket, as it were to inform himſelf of the way, which hee ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have loſt. This was <hi>Arcade,</hi> whom <hi>Serife</hi> had retained having ſent away <hi>Armelin</hi> and <hi>Philaſter;</hi> hee having his Leſſon, took no notice of them, but as <hi>Peaſants;</hi> and thus ſpake to them: <hi>Friend's, what evill Spirit brought you hither to diſturb the Silence, and re-double the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of this place with your quarrel ſome debates? Yet I am not ſorry I have met with you, ſince your arrivall may do an afflicted</hi> Lady, <hi>and mee ſome ſervice in ſetting us again into the way, which wee have been long ſeeking without hapning upon any body to direct us.</hi> Hee had no ſooner uttered theſe words, but <hi>Piſides,</hi> knowing him by his Voyce, and Cloathes, anſwered; Arcade, <hi>what do you perſist in the inchantment, which maketh you not know, (when your Eyes are open) thoſe to whom you ſpeak? Do not you remember, that you ſaw us not many Dayes ſince in theſe Cloaths, when the Chaſe made you put a Stag into our Hands?</hi> At theſe words, <hi>Arcade,</hi> as if hee had been much ſurpriſed, Replied, <hi>Oh my Lord</hi> Piſides. <hi>what good</hi> Angell <hi>directed you ſo opportunely into this ſolitude to the ſuccor of our</hi> Palatine's Lady, <hi>whom a violent, though not unjuſt</hi> Jealouſie <hi>doth inforce to traverſe both</hi> City <hi>and</hi> Country! Upon further inquiry hee told them (as hee had been inſtructed by <hi>Serife, that Modeſtina,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:51476:85"/> beeing arrived at <hi>Plocens,</hi> had commanded him to conduct her into that <hi>Foreſt,</hi> where ſhee had learnt, that the <hi>Palatine,</hi> her Husband, beeing taken with the <hi>Love</hi> of a <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> had relinquiſhed the care of his <hi>Charge,</hi> and contemned the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of his Dignity and Birth.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> beeing prepoſſeſſed with ſo many Charms, accoſted the ſorrowfull <hi>Lady,</hi> who ſeeing them approach ſeemed to bee much affrighted, yet ſettled her Countenance again, as ſoon as <hi>Arcade,</hi> ſtepping in before the reſt, informed her, that thoſe, whom ſhee ſaw in <hi>Peaſant's</hi> Habits, were <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of Quality of the <hi>Palatine's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, whom they ſought as well as ſhee; Hee having eclypſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from their ſights ſome Dayes ſince. They having never ſeen <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtina,</hi> doubted not but <hi>Serife</hi> was ſhee; For (beſides the Dreſs and Accoutrements of a <hi>Lady</hi> of note, wherewith ſhee was ſumptuouſly attired) ſhee had ſo mortified, or rather dyed her Face with a certain yellowiſh Liquor, that it ſeemed <hi>Mellancholly</hi> had given her the <hi>Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> Beſides, by the means of ſome device which ſhee held in her Mouth, ſhee feined another voyce ſo naturally, that they were deceived on all ſides. After they had made their obeiſance, and tendred all the ſervices due to her <hi>Grandeur: The onely ſervice,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>that I deſire of you, is, that you would bring mee into my Husband's preſence, or do mee the laſt of all Duties, put mee into my Sepulcher; For, to bee ſeparated from him, and to die, is the ſame thing to mee.</hi> Hereupon they ſwore to uſe their beſt indeavours (but to make good their Oaths they needed not go out of the place) conjuring her to riſe, and permit them to ſet her upon her Horſe, which was feeding cloſe by with <hi>Arcade's.</hi> As ſhee moved her ſelf, ſhee eſpied <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> amongſt them, on whom caſting a ſtern look, <hi>And dareſt thou yet</hi> (ſaid ſhee) <hi>appear before mee, thou diſloyall ſervant to a faithleſs</hi> Maſter? <hi>After thou haſt ſo miſguided him, who was committed to thy Government, thou comeſt perchance with thy Companions diſguiſed, like thy ſelf, to plunge mee into new Miſeries, and caſt mee into another Priſon. Ah! No, I will rather open my boſome with this blade</hi> (drawing a Dagger from under her Robe) <hi>than commit my ſelfe to the Mercy of unknown Perſons, who may firſt attempt my</hi> Honour, <hi>and afterwards take my</hi> Life. Here <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> putting one Knee to Ground, anſwered, <hi>Madam, Let Heaven never pardon mee, if I am culpable of any miſdemeanour towards you, and when you know the condition of theſe</hi> Gentlemen (<hi>whereof there is not one that would not loſe a thouſand lives for the preſervation of your</hi> Honour) <hi>you will bee ſorry
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51476:86"/> for conceiving ſuch a ſuspition of them. I take the</hi> Sun, <hi>or rather him that give's it</hi> Light <hi>to witneſs, that it is no fault of mine, if</hi> Iphigenes <hi>hath not continued his Affections entire (as hee ought) to you. But alas! I am no more his</hi> Governour, <hi>but by Name, hee is my</hi> Maſter <hi>in effect, the truth (as to all great Perſons) is become odious to him, hee ſpurn's at Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances; instead of taking my adviſes in good part, hee paye's them with injuries; his anſwers are harſh and froward, I cannot read his humour, hee is grown ſo extravagant (theſe</hi> Gentlemen <hi>know it as well as I) that I am not able to hold him; yet for my part, if I have not Power ſufficient to ſtay him, I have Patience to let him run, but not Conſtancy enough not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his condition. His Diſgrace at</hi> Court <hi>is one ſtep to his fall, and if hee continue in his obſtinacy, that</hi> Goſſip <hi>which hath bewitched him (I think) will ruine him abſolutely both in</hi> Body, Mind <hi>and</hi> Reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> Boleſlaus, replyed the feined Modeſtina, <hi>if by the contagion of that deceitfull Spirit thou art not become impudent as well as hee; if thy words are ſincere, tell mee, if I muſt loſe all hope of regaining his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the end I may preſently by</hi> Death <hi>ſet a period to all my Miſcries. Madam,</hi> ſaid Pomeran, <hi>that remedy were worſe than the Diſeaſe; For, it is eaſier to reſuſcitate affection in an</hi> Heart, <hi>than recall a</hi> Soul <hi>into a</hi> Body <hi>when once it is departed; For</hi> Heaven's <hi>ſake baniſh ſuch deſperate Thoughts, and caſt away that murtherous Weapon which ſo ill become's your hand; And I ſwear to you by the Faith of a Man of Honour, that if I were not ſeconded by any of theſe Gentlemen (although their Friendſhip &amp; Courteſie promiſeth mee otherwiſe of their Generoſity) I will employ my Sword with thoſe of my Friends, my Industry, my Diligence, and my own Life, to procure your repoſe &amp; reduce</hi> Iphigenes <hi>to reaſon. Theſe Gentlemen can tell what Diſputes I have had with him upon this Account, and how often hee hath gone diſpleaſod out of my Company, becauſe hee could no more brook the Liberty which I took in ſpeaking to him, than I the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinage of his Life; But that was nothing to what I now deſire to ſay and do, beeing no leſs animated by the ſight of your Afflictions, than the</hi> Romans <hi>were moved at the view of</hi> Ceſar's <hi>bloody Shirt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was not one of the Company, but ingaged with <hi>Pomeran</hi> to lay their Lives down upon ſo juſt a quarrell, eſpecially <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> as if by that imployment hee deſired to efface the ſuſpition, which ſhee had conceived of him. Here <hi>Arcade,</hi> (who could not perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that thoſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> whom hee had ſeen ſo frequently and ſo familiar with <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> could bee ſo deceived) began to laugh upon <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> ſaying to him in his Ear, <hi>That hee could not ſufficiently admire the dexterity of the</hi> Palatine <hi>and him, in repreſenting their Perſonages.</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:51476:86"/> That whiſpering caſt ſome jealouſie into <hi>Pomeran's</hi> thoughts, which was increaſed by <hi>Arcade's</hi> often ſmiling afterwards and winking upon <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> whereby a perſon of mean underſtanding might have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceived a ſecret intelligence.</p>
               <p>Another time <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> (fearing a Diſcovery) drawing <hi>Arcade</hi> aſide to tell him in ſecret <hi>that under pain of incurring the</hi> Palatine's <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee ſhould bee more ſerious in his carriage, leſt his lightneſs betrayed all; Argal,</hi> who was fallen into <hi>Pomeran's</hi> ſuſpition, ſaid alowd; <hi>Senior</hi> Boleſlaus, <hi>amongst friends nothing ought to bee concealed, ſpeak out, that wee may know what you are plotting there with</hi> Arcade; <hi>For, if it bee any thing that may countervene not onely the Service, but the will of this</hi> Lady, <hi>wee proteſt to oppoſe your deſigns with all our power according to our promiſe without exception; For, though wee are her</hi> Husband's <hi>friends, wee are friends no further than to the</hi> Altar; <hi>that is, as far as Vertue and Conſcience do extend, beyond thoſe bounds wee know not what it is to love. If hee renounce not his no leſs unjust than injurious</hi> Paſſion <hi>for that idle</hi> Almeria <hi>which hath metamorphoſed him into a</hi> Shepherd, <hi>and quench in the legimate embraces of his Spouſe the illicite flames where with the other hath poſſeſſed his Heart, and robbed him of the uſe of</hi> Reaſon, <hi>what complacency ſoever wee expreſſed heretofore to flatter his humour, wee are determined now to leave his ſervice.</hi> This hee ſpake with ſuch ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (animating his Speech with a ſharp and colerick tone) as there remained no doubt in <hi>Arcade's</hi> thoughts, but that they were really deceived, or that they diſſembled purpoſely to deceive him; and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Fool of their Play, produce him for their laughing ſtock and the ſubject of their merriment.</p>
               <p>At length, notwithſtanding all the ſigns <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> made him to contein himſelf, and the auſtere look which <hi>Modeſtina</hi> glanced to keep him in awe, hee could not refrain from laughter, when hee heard <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> return this excuſe to <hi>Argal.</hi> 
                  <q>That which I would have ſaid to <hi>Arcade</hi> in private, was onely to inquire of the particulars of this <hi>Ladie's</hi> eſcape out of Priſon; For, <hi>Mieſlas</hi> kept her ſo cloſe in one of his Caſtles, out of which it ſeemed ſo impoſſible for her to get, that I think <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf could hardly have found an invention to penetrate it, although hee ſhould have reſumed the ſame form, which facilitated his conqueſt of <hi>Acriſius</hi> his Daughter; or had ſhee been a <hi>Flora,</hi> I know not how <hi>Zephyrus</hi> could have accoſted her.</q> The feined <hi>Modeſtina</hi> to give colour to this invention, and to hinder thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> from diſcovering the whole Myſtery by <hi>Arcade's</hi> imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent laughing, replyed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>You cannot conceive how ſubtile a</hi> Woman's <hi>Wit is, eſpecially when ſharpened by</hi> Love, <hi>and refin'd by</hi> Jealouſie; <hi>you onely look upon the guards that did environ mee, and do not conſider that a</hi> Woman, <hi>who hath a mind to deceive, or free her perſon out of Captivity, maketh thoſe, who are incharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to watch her, the Instruments of effecting her own Deſigns: you might rather wonder how the news of my Huſband's licentiouſneſs-ſhould pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate my Ears in that recluſe Manſion; But without having recourſe to the</hi> Divell <hi>or</hi> Magick Art, <hi>know, that ſuſpitions are</hi> Lover's <hi>Meſſengers, and their inquiries are ſo frequent and ſo urgent, that hardly any thing that regardeth the Object beloved can eſcape their knowledge: and I muſt tell you, that my diligence hath been ſuch, that</hi> Iphigenes <hi>hath not done any one thing ſince his firſt going out of</hi> Podolia, <hi>either at the</hi> Court, <hi>or in his</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, <hi>but I know it as well as hee; and were hee now preſent, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him all his unworthineſſes one after the other, and reveal his ſhame to his own Face; neither ſhould hee be able to contradict or oppoſe any excuſe to the Verities which I ſhould alledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Anſwer <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> returned <hi>Argal,</hi> put <hi>Arcade</hi> out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, this tranſported him beyond himſelf; and burſting into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive laughter, his Imprudence ſerved in ſtead of the Oculiſt's <hi>Collyriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to make the <hi>films</hi> fall from the Eyes of thoſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who doubting already ſome pretty prank of <hi>Joviality,</hi> perceived at length their <hi>Error;</hi> inſomuch that the ſad and <hi>Tragicall</hi> beginning of this <hi>Cheat</hi> ended with a <hi>Catastrophe</hi> ſo <hi>Comicall,</hi> that the Deceived, as well as the Deceivers were marvelouſly delighted with that recreation.</p>
               <p>After this the feined <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> to take entirely off that Mask (which rendred her not abſolutely unknown, but much harder to bee known) having dipped her Handkerchief in the Brook, and rubbed her Face therewith, wiped away that yellowiſh colour, which altered her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Which done, ſhee ſeemed ſo beautifull, that had not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall tone of her voyce (which ſhee uſed again, having taken out of her mouth that which ſhee had put in to falſifie it) aſſured them that it was <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in a <hi>Woman's</hi> habit, they would have been more difficulty drawn out of this ſecond error than the former. Then, they fell to diſcourſe freely, and the <hi>Palatine</hi> declared to them, wherefore he had taken a <hi>Woman's</hi> habit to deceive them, as <hi>Calliante</hi> had done in <hi>Man's,</hi> who was no other than <hi>Almeria</hi> diſguiſed.</p>
               <p>This new Diſcovery bred a new altoniſhment, and every one of the Company thought himſelf over head and Ears in inchantments. And the deceived party regretted, that they had not continued longer in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51476:87"/> their agreeable error, that in the ſincerity of their actions the <hi>Palatine</hi> might have read the fidelity of their friendſhip, and judged by its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, that their Souls permitted them not to be Favourers of Vice: So <hi>Arcade</hi> was taunted on both ſides, for having betrayed by his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, what had been contrived with ſo much ſubtility. But as in Spring-time, the <hi>Heavens</hi> beeing grown inamored of the <hi>Earth,</hi> do heat her boſome with the rayes of the <hi>Sun,</hi> you may hear the <hi>Birds</hi> chanting their <hi>Love-layes</hi> in ſeverall Notes; So, <hi>Serife</hi> perceived by their language, that the powerfull glances of her <hi>Eyes</hi> had warmed the <hi>Hearts</hi> of thoſe diſguiſed Peaſants: For, from extolling her Beauty beyond any thing <hi>Nature</hi> had yet produced, they fell to particularize her perfections, with ſuch curioſity, that it was eaſie to judge that their Paſſion was the main Spring of their Eloquence. And as thoſe who are over-maſtered by Wine, diſcloſe their infirmities by a flux of incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, whereby one may gather that their <hi>Brains</hi> are troubled with Fumes, which cloud and diſturb the faculties of the <hi>Intellect;</hi> So, by the diſcourſe of theſe three admirers, it evidently appeared, <hi>that</hi> that ſweet <hi>Poyſon</hi> which is drunk by the <hi>Eyes,</hi> had diſtilled its maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into their <hi>Breſts,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> their mouths pronounced but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the abundance of their deſires. <hi>Argal</hi> complained that <hi>Nature</hi> had not made <hi>Iphigenes</hi> a <hi>Woman; Piſides</hi> flattering his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Error, ſaid, <hi>That as the</hi> Hyena <hi>is reported to change her Sex with her hair, ſo perchance</hi> Iphis <hi>having metamorphoſed himſelf into</hi> Serife, <hi>and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the habit of</hi> Male, <hi>was become a</hi> Female. Penſive <hi>Pomeran,</hi> who though hee ſpake not all hee thought, could not chuſe but let ſlip ſome Expreſſions, which like ſparks gave teſtimony of his inward fire; For, ſometimes hee confeſſed himſelf filled with vain illuſions, and to avoid a prejudiciall cenſure, in ſatisfying his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> he proteſted <hi>that</hi> hee would remain to the laſt Breath a <hi>friend</hi> to <hi>Iphis,</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi> to the incomparable <hi>Serife.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He perplexity of <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> was no leſs than <hi>Serife's</hi> apprehenſion, leſt what ſhe had ſo long, and ſo ſeriouſly concealed ſhould now be unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly revealed, to the ruine of her <hi>Fortune,</hi> &amp; perchance of her <hi>Honour.</hi> At length it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Deſign ſhould ſtill continue to deceive the <hi>Country-People,</hi> to make themſelves ſome Paſtime with their Simplicity. To this effect leſt <hi>Arcade</hi> by his indiſcretion ſhould give occaſion of any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion likewiſe to the Ruſticks, <hi>Serife</hi> ſent him back to <hi>Plocens,</hi> incharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him not to mention any thing of thoſe Divertiſements, which ſhee would have buried in the ſilence and ſolitude of the Woods. That
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51476:88"/> done, they repaired towards <hi>Celian's</hi> Houſe, whither <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a little before the reſt, to ſee if <hi>Calliante</hi> with his attendants were returned from their Inqueſt: But hee found only the old <hi>Man</hi> accompanyed with his <hi>Daughters,</hi> deploring the loſs of his <hi>profit</hi> more than the abſence of the two <hi>Lovers,</hi> who hee imagined had loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on purpoſe to finde a more free poſſeſſion of each other. Some queſtions being paſt, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> told him, that hee had other news for him, which was, <hi>That the Wife of</hi> Iphis, <hi>being transported with Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, was come into thoſe Woods to ſeek him, where ſhee had been informed hee spent his time in the Embraces of</hi> Almeria, <hi>and that his Companions, who had by chance met with her, had ſent him before to know if hee would bee willing to receive her in his houſe, ſhee being a</hi> Lady <hi>of quality, that had fufficiently where withall to recompence his ſervices and Courteſie to her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That hope of <hi>Gaine</hi> was the onely Shaft hee could have ſhot to hit the pretenſions of that greedy <hi>Churle;</hi> His Ears and his Dores were preſently opened at the ſound of that <hi>Silver</hi> Bell. And whileſt they were upon theſe terms, arrived the other three, leading the beautifull <hi>Serife</hi> as it were in Triumph, upon a handſome Nag, whoſe Furniture was correſpondent to the Richneſs of her Apparrell. That rare Beauty wherewith <hi>Nature</hi> had Favored her, being increaſed by the Luſter of thoſe pretious Garments, ſo dazled the weak ſights of <hi>Belida, Merinda</hi> and <hi>Remonda,</hi> that they did not onely forget the Graces of <hi>Almeria,</hi> but loſt the remembrance of the countenance of <hi>Iphis.</hi> So certain it is, that <hi>Cloathes do ſet off people in ſuch ſort, that they ſeem in a manner Metamorphoſed. Celian</hi> looked no further than her <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Neck,</hi> whither his <hi>Eyes</hi> were invited by the ſparkling of ſome rich <hi>Rings,</hi> and a <hi>Carcanet</hi> of pretious Stones, which hee already ſwallowed in his Fancy. Every one's attentions were divertiſed according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent inclinations; the <hi>Courtiers</hi> admired the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Serife,</hi> the Shepherdeſſes the <hi>Magnificence,</hi> and their old Father the <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This feined <hi>Syrene</hi> being received (if not according to her merit, however in the beſt manner that Cottage could afford) renewed the deceipt which ſhee had ſo artificially begun in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> and poſſeſſed thoſe ſimple People (who devoured her words by Mouth-fulls) with what belief ſhee liſted, telling them, That <hi>ſhee was Legitimate Spouſe to</hi> Iphis (<hi>and indeed they were but one and the ſame Fleſh, their</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction <hi>being not onely <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi>) That <hi>ſhee had ſought that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51476:89"/> Perfidious and Ingratefull</hi> Man <hi>both by</hi> Land <hi>and</hi> Sea; That <hi>Hee had Traiterouſly abandoned her to</hi> Deſpair, <hi>forſaking her to follow an Idle Creature, who being little beholding to</hi> Nature <hi>for</hi> Beauty, <hi>had doubtleſs bewitched her Husband by ſome</hi> Magicall <hi>Charms; And yet (ſaid ſhee) I love him (notwithſtanding his Diſloyalty) as dearly as my ſelf, and if you pleaſe to meaſure his</hi> Malice <hi>by my</hi> Innocency, <hi>I am in ſome kinde culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of my own misfortune, for, I am the</hi> Cauſe <hi>that my</hi> Rivall <hi>doth intirely poſſeſs</hi> Iphis. All this diſcourſe, which had a double meaning, was throughly underſtood by none but <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire the dexterity of his dear Foſter-child, who the better to cover her Deceipt, drawing a Chain of Sighs from the bottome of her Heart, and drowning her Cheeks with Tears, moved not only the Daughters, but <hi>Celian</hi> himſelf to Compaſſion, and bred Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Courtiers</hi> to ſee her ſubtility in repreſenting ſo to the life, a Sorrow, which they thought was feined. But thoſe Sighs &amp; Tears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from, but too reall, a Source of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> ſo that the Deceipt held good on all ſides. And, it being a curioſity as Blameleſs as <hi>Naturall,</hi> to inquire into the Diſaſters of Afflicted perſons, to remedy them if it bee in our power, or at leaſt to pitty the ſufferers if wee cannot help them, the Shepherdeſſes who deſired no leſs to learn ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars concerning <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Almeria,</hi> than to hear the <hi>Ladie's</hi> Story, beſeeched her to give them the relation of her Afflictions, aſſuring her of their Fidelity; and promiſing, in exchange, to tell her what they knew concerning thoſe two <hi>Perſons,</hi> whom <hi>Paſſion</hi> had rendred extravagant. Then, <hi>Serife,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> having made her ſelf bee ſomewhat intreated, diſpoſing them by that appetite, the more eaſily to believe her Inventions, thus began.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Iphis</hi> and I were Married ſo yong, that wee could hardly know what 'twas to <hi>Love.</hi> I was Ward to his <hi>Father,</hi> who to draw my Eſtate into his Family, &amp; of a <hi>Guardian</hi> become <hi>Maſter</hi> of all, made me Marry his <hi>Son.</hi> If there was any force on <hi>Iphis</hi> part, I know not, but in mee (I am ſure) there was no Conſtraint, for I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ever I ſaw him without having ſome inclination for him. From the Cradle almoſt wee were brought up together: during our Childhood wee loved like Children, and our Affections increaſing with our years, I loved him afterwards as my brother, but I muſt confeſſe after I was permitted to hope to injoy him as a Husband, I began to cheriſh him with a <hi>Love</hi> more ardent and delicate.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51476:89"/> At length we were united by the bonds of <hi>Hymen,</hi> but alas! that was only in words, for the uſe of our bodies was forbidden by his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who in reſpect of his tenderneſs of Age and Complexion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred our contentments untill riper years had given both of us more Vigour and Ability to conſummate our Marriage. Yet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the form of like Ceremonies, wee were both layed in one Bed, but with an old <hi>Governeſs,</hi> (that I had) betwixt us, who like a <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> did extinguiſh all our ardour, imprinting in our Spirits ſo much reſpect and awe, that during the whole Night, the motions of <hi>Love</hi> had no acceſs in our Bodies. After that, to take away all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of our accoſting, and to deprive us of our ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Hee was ſent to the <hi>Court,</hi> where his good parts rendring him the common deſire of the moſt accompliſhed <hi>Ladies,</hi> Hee ſtill made me believe by his Letters (which were my only conſolation in his abſence) that among ſo many <hi>Stars</hi> which glittered before his Eyes, none could attract his ſight from his <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe <hi>Eclypſe</hi> overwhelmed him with as much Darkneſs, as hee hoped to injoy Light, when I ſhould again appear in his preſence. With a thouſand ſuch like fopperies did that <hi>deceiver</hi> amuſe my Simplicity, whileſt in the midſt of his Triumph over ſo many hearts, inthralled by his merits, hee became, I know not how, a Slave to a <hi>Fugitive,</hi> which leads him up and down <hi>Captive</hi> where ſhee pleaſeth. Upon certain advice whereof I have done what I could by Letters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him into the trace of his <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> But Hee <hi>ſometimes</hi> denyed flatly that report, <hi>ſometimes</hi> hee accuſed mee of <hi>Jealouſie, ſometimes</hi> diſguiſed his baſeneſs in ſo many faſhions, proteſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly againſt my <hi>Suspition,</hi> and making ſuch ſhew of <hi>Innocence,</hi> that (eaſie foole as I was) I belied my own <hi>belief</hi> to conform my ſelf to his <hi>perſwaſions;</hi> and to purge him of <hi>crime,</hi> I accuſed my ſelf of too much <hi>credulity.</hi> Oh how eaſie a thing it is to circumvent a <hi>Soul</hi> whoſe affection diſpoſeth it to take in good part all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed's from the Object beloved! But at laſt perceiving by his flight with this new <hi>Hellen,</hi> whom hee hath raviſhed with her own conſent; <hi>that</hi> (like a ſilly <hi>Fiſh</hi>) I had ſwallowed the <hi>hook</hi> under the <hi>bait,</hi> and what I held but for a <hi>Fiction</hi> was too manifeſt a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> alſolutely deſtructive to my contentment: <hi>Love</hi> armed with <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie</hi> ſuggeſted ſuch reproaches to my Tongue againſt his barbarous Perfidiouſneſs, as you may better conjecture than I repeat; I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> I accuſed the Innocence of the

                     <hi>Stars,</hi> as if their <hi>influence</hi> had contributed ſomewhat to his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and ſtrewing my Chamber with whole handfulls of my hair, I bruiſed my breſt with my own Fiſts, puniſhing my ſelf for the faults which hee had committed againſt me. His <hi>Father</hi> as <hi>cruell</hi> as hee is <hi>faithleſs,</hi> kept me cloſe Priſoner in a Caſtle, where this news, which afflicted mee even to <hi>Death,</hi> could enter, but I had little hopes of getting out, to prevent by my Liberty this ruine of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Marriage. My condition was like a Man's who ſeeth his Houſe burning before his face, and is not able to carry any <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to quench the <hi>Fire;</hi> Yet, beſides that <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is ingenious, the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> (which watcheth over the afflicted) gave mee the invention and means to free my ſelf from that Captivity to ſeek my <hi>Husband,</hi> &amp; indeavour to draw him out of that Mire of Deboiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereinto he is plunged: And being informed in a <hi>City</hi> not far from hence, that my <hi>Husband</hi> (who is but too well known amongſt the chief of this <hi>Province</hi>) had retired himſelf into this <hi>Foreſt,</hi> where under pretence of Hunting hee made <hi>Love</hi> to a Shepherdeſs (which is no other than that <hi>Almeria,</hi> diſguiſed in a <hi>Country</hi> habit) without taking any other counſell than that of my <hi>Affection,</hi> I came at a venter hither, not knowing which way to direct my Courſe, to meet with <hi>him</hi> who hath ſtolen my <hi>Heart,</hi> and robbed mee of his <hi>Faith.</hi> Thus <hi>Courteous Shepherdeſses,</hi> you have the ſumm of my ſad adventures, and the Subject of my coming amongſt you.

               <p>Here <hi>Serife</hi> cut off her Diſcourſe with <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> which came ſo opportunely from her, that one would have ſaid ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> in particular places of ſtore, to let them out when ſhee liſted. The <hi>Gentlemen</hi> (who knew the <hi>Fallacie,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the readineſs of her <hi>wit,</hi> which could ſo dexterouſly mingle <hi>Fables</hi> with <hi>Truths,</hi> and ſpeak things of ſuch double ſence, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhe ſaid favoured of any improbability) were leſs moved than the <hi>Shepherdeſſes;</hi> who believing nothing more certain, than that which ſhee had told them, felt powerfull reſentments of <hi>Compaſſion</hi> at her ſo handſomely feined <hi>Sorrow.</hi> And as the blood in <hi>Humane</hi> bodies runneth to the part that is wounded, as it were to ſtrengthen and cheer it up; ſo it being <hi>Naturall</hi> to comfort them whoſe affliction toucheth us, either by leſſening their <hi>grief</hi> with the <hi>lenitive</hi> of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>words,</hi> Recalling their ſenſes from <hi>Deſpair</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Making them hope for a <hi>change</hi> of their evill <hi>Fortune,</hi> Promiſing <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> to withdraw or abate the <hi>miſeries</hi> which oppreſs them, or by ſome other <hi>ingredients</hi> whereof are compoſed the <hi>Cataplaſms,</hi> that are applyed to the <hi>wounds</hi> of the <hi>Heart:</hi> Thoſe <hi>Geatlemen,</hi> who ſaw all theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with a ſingular ſatisfaction, having (to bring on the reſt) firſt made offer of their Services to the diſconſolate <hi>Serife,</hi> for the conquering of her inconſtant <hi>Husband,</hi> expected to ſee how the <hi>Shepherdeſses</hi> would
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51476:91"/> undoe that <hi>knot</hi> which the <hi>Lady</hi> had knit and tangled with as much Art, as that which could not bee looſed without the <hi>Edge</hi> of a <hi>Sword.</hi>

               <p>Their pitty preſently ingaged them in the like tender of aſſiſtance to her, and (<hi>Women</hi> beeing as capable of keeping a <hi>ſecret</hi> as the <hi>reeds</hi> that betrayed <hi>Midas</hi> Aſſes Ears) they declared to her all they knew of <hi>Almeria's</hi> deportments; <hi>how</hi> ſhee came thither in <hi>Man's</hi> cloaths, which ſhee left in <hi>Merinda's</hi> hands as a pledge for thoſe which ſhee procured her; <hi>How Iphis</hi> came after her in a <hi>Countrey-man's</hi> habit with thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> there preſent; <hi>How</hi> ſhee had fed them with lies, <hi>ſometimes</hi> ſaying <hi>ſhee</hi> was a <hi>Maid, ſometimes</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> with ſo well-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a diſſimulation, that they knew not what to think of her; ſuch Sweetneſs and Modeſty ſhee ſhewed amongſt <hi>Women,</hi> ſuch <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>dexterity</hi> beeing in the company of <hi>Men;</hi> That <hi>ſometimes</hi> ſhee acknowledged ſhee had committed a <hi>fault,</hi> and therefore had ſtolen from her <hi>Parents,</hi> fearing their diſpleaſure, <hi>Sometimes</hi> again ſhee would juſtifie her ſelf to bee full of <hi>Honour,</hi> and as immaculate as a new born <hi>Babe:</hi> However (as <hi>Detraction</hi> eaſily ſlippeth into Reports) for their parts, they ſaid, if ſhee was <hi>honeſt,</hi> they <hi>believed</hi> it was in <hi>words</hi> onely, not in <hi>effect;</hi> then, they conſtrued in the worſt ſenſe the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which <hi>Iphis</hi> expreſſed for her, and the feined <hi>rigours</hi> wherewith ſhee rejected his <hi>purſuit:</hi> In ſumme, they all concluded <hi>that</hi> her run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away with that <hi>Man</hi> convinced her ſufficiently of the <hi>crime,</hi> which ſhee had before diſguiſed with ſuch cunning.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Serife</hi> (to make her ſelf ſport by ſounding the <hi>malice</hi> of thoſe <hi>Ruſtick</hi> Souls) preſſing them, as if ſhee had been animated with a <hi>jealous</hi> curioſity, to diſcover freely to her, what <hi>ſuſpitious,</hi> or unbeſeeming <hi>actions</hi> they had obſerved betwixt thoſe two <hi>Lovers; ſuch tricks,</hi> replyed Merinda <hi>ſeek</hi> Darkneſs <hi>more than the</hi> Light; <hi>witneſſes are not required at ſuch bargains; thoſe that have a mind to doe amiſs, indeavour at leaſt</hi> that <hi>Solitude and Silence may ſhelter their faults from Judgements and Murmures. I perceive, ſaid</hi> Serife, <hi>that you deal with mee as</hi> Chirurgeons <hi>do with thoſe who apprehend letting Blood, amuſing their Eyes another way, whileſt they open the</hi> Veine; <hi>or, as the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſometimes with criminalls, covering their Faces, that they may not ſee the inſtruments of their puniſhments; you veil my miſchief, and thereby redouble my torment: For, it is ſome conſolation to ſee on which ſide one fall's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Belida</hi> took occaſion to ſpeak thus, <hi>Madam, the Jelouſie which poſſeſſeth you, and which for a time did likewiſe diſquiet my Braine, is a</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:51476:91"/> Diſeaſe <hi>that maketh us ſeek what wee would be grieved to finde; it forgeth oft-times</hi> Idea's <hi>of that which is not, maketh ſmall treſpaſſes ſeem great offences, and like a malign</hi> Ulcer, <hi>impoyſoneth it ſelf by the ſame reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are applied to cure it; any</hi> Wood <hi>will foment that</hi> Fire, <hi>but no</hi> Water <hi>can quench it. If you will bee ruled by mee, you ſhall content your ſelf with that</hi> little <hi>which we have told you of the</hi> much <hi>which wee know; for your imagination, (ingenious to torment your ſelf) will extend but too far, (to your ſorrow) the particulars wee have already repreſented. I ſpeak by experience of that</hi> Malady, <hi>which is worſe than a quartane</hi> Ague, <hi>for, it proceed's from an odd conceited humour, which every thing doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and nothing eaſeth;</hi> Heavens <hi>bee praiſed I am now rid of it, and I hope I never ſhall bee afflicted with the like pain. I am confident,</hi> Madam, <hi>as the</hi> Starrs <hi>loſe their Light in the preſence of the</hi> Sun, <hi>that your</hi> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>having but compared your</hi> Beauty <hi>with that which hee now ſo eſteemeth in</hi> Almeria, <hi>will account all her</hi> Graces <hi>uglineſs, and the more deformed, becauſe accompained with the vileſt and moſt infamous of</hi> vices, <hi>which is</hi> Adultery; <hi>and</hi> that <hi>balancing your</hi> Fidelity <hi>with the</hi> Lightneſs <hi>of her</hi> indiſcretion, <hi>hee will the ſooner acknowledge his</hi> fault, <hi>the greater Obligation hee hath to your merit. For, as wee finde by experience</hi> that <hi>the Sheep which have been drawn out of the</hi> Wolv's <hi>Throat, are the tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and daintiest meat; So his</hi> Love <hi>doubtleſs will bee the ſweeter and more firm towards you, the greater his</hi> Repentance <hi>is for having offended ſuch a</hi> Goodneſs, <hi>and tempted ſuch a</hi> Patience <hi>as yours. Live in this hope,</hi> Madam, <hi>and aſſure your ſelf, that if</hi> Iphis <hi>hath two Eyes, and ſeeth you,</hi> Almeria's <hi>gone; ſhee will bee the Object of his</hi> Diſdaine, <hi>and you of his</hi> Affection; <hi>Perchance the difficulty of poſſeſſing you, hath tranſported him to this no leſs unjuſt than inconſiderate</hi> Paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remonda</hi> (after the manner of <hi>Women,</hi> who would bee ſorry to hold their peace when others ſpeak) interrupting <hi>Belida,</hi> would alſo pay her <hi>ſhot</hi> with the <hi>mite</hi> of her <hi>verdict,</hi> adding to her Opinion an expedient remedy to eaſe the <hi>Lady Serife's</hi> plain, to whom addreſſing her Speech; <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>It ſeeme's that</hi> Heaven <hi>conſpiring your good, hath ſent hither on purpoſe a</hi> Man <hi>that will releaſe you of that trouble, by tearing</hi> Almeria <hi>out of your</hi> Husband's <hi>Armes, and putting him into yours; it is one</hi> Calliante, <hi>who ſaye's hee is her</hi> Brother: <hi>hee came hither yeſterday to inquire after her, and is gone this Morning with my</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>to ſee if they can finde them out. I marry Siſter,</hi> replyed <hi>Merinda, there's a</hi> ſalve <hi>indeed for this Ladie's</hi> ſore, <hi>to tell her of a</hi> Gentleman <hi>that is come with an intention to kill</hi> Iphis, <hi>or make him marry her whom hee
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51476:92"/> hath abuſed, which will be an abſolute diſſolving of his former Marriage, which is not</hi> conſummated, <hi>by another whoſe</hi> conſummation <hi>hath preceded the</hi> Wedding.</p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Serife</hi> ſeeming extreamly diſturbed, feined to fall into a ſwound; and as there is no body ſo deaf as hee that will not hear, ſo there is none ſo ſick as thoſe that counterfeit themſelves to be ſo: <hi>Serife</hi> diſſembled her indiſpoſition with ſuch Art, that every one judged it to bee reall; ſome ran to fetch <hi>Vineger</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> whileſt ſome pinched her, and others rubbed her Face; the <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her after their faſhion (that is) rudely, yet for all their doing ſhee ſtirred not, ſo that they thought her paſt recovery. The <hi>Courtiers</hi> knew not whether they had beſt laugh or cry; and in effect ſhee had continued longer in that pleaſant extaſie, if, when they came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her, ſhee had not feared (by leaving to the view of thoſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſes</hi> and <hi>Lynxes</hi> the pretious treaſures of her boſom) that without <hi>divination</hi> they would have paſſed from <hi>Conjecture</hi> to the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Truth.</hi> So ſhee awaked out of that ſweet <hi>Sleep,</hi> as full of <hi>Joy</hi> in her <hi>Heart</hi> to ſee her <hi>Deceipt</hi> take ſo handſomly, as of <hi>Sorrow</hi> in her <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;</hi> For, all her <hi>Blood</hi> beeing retired inwards, ſhee looked as pale as <hi>Death,</hi> and watering at the ſame time her <hi>Cheeks</hi> with <hi>Pearls,</hi> which ſhee had prepared in her <hi>Eyes,</hi> with a trembling, and, as it were, a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyce, ſhe formed theſe words. <hi>Who was that which by an indeavour pitifully cruell hath reſtored the</hi> Light <hi>to my</hi> Eyes, <hi>to make mee contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate in my ſelf a</hi> Spectacle <hi>of nothing but</hi> Miſeries? Oh <hi>Death! the onely Conſolation of thoſe who are remedileſly afflicted, why doſt thou ſeiſe on ſo many perſons that ſhun thee in the midſt of their Delights, and leaveſt mee in this</hi> World, <hi>who invoke thee without ceaſe, unleſs thy meaning bee to make my</hi> Head <hi>a</hi> Butt <hi>for all</hi> Misfortunes? <hi>Then, the</hi> Deſigne <hi>is to rob</hi> Iphis <hi>of his</hi> Life, <hi>or raviſh him</hi> alive <hi>from mee; from mee who</hi> Live <hi>not but for him and in him, and who to ſave his</hi> Life <hi>would loſe mine own, or rather many</hi> Lives, <hi>if I had them, to reſcue him from</hi> Death. <hi>Oh</hi> Deſtiny! <hi>if thy</hi> Rigour <hi>bee yet ſuſceptible of any ſpark of</hi> Pitty, <hi>cloſe my</hi> Eyes <hi>with that</hi> Sleep, <hi>out of which one never wake's, before they ſee ſo tragicall an Event.</hi> My dear Friends, <hi>pray give mee leave to</hi> die, <hi>for it is time that by this laſt action I teſtifie to my</hi> Faithleſs Husband, <hi>how much I cheriſh his</hi> Liberty, <hi>and</hi> that <hi>if I have not</hi> ſtrength <hi>enough to follow and overtake him, I have</hi> conſtancy <hi>enough to let him pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſaid, ſhee would have drawn out of her ſleeve, hanging after
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51476:92"/> the <hi>Sarmatick</hi> faſhion, the ſame Dagger wherewith ſhee feined to kill herſelf in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> had not the diſguiſed <hi>Gentlemen</hi> held her Arm; but there needed no great ſtriving to hinder <hi>her</hi> from hurting herſelf, who had no ſuch intent, and who would have wounded <hi>Iphis</hi> aſſoon as <hi>herſelf.</hi> Mean time this ſtrengthened the <hi>Deceipt:</hi> For, as there is no tincture ſo lively as that of blood, ſo there is no impreſſion ſo powerfull as that which is mingled with ſome <hi>tragicall</hi> effect. The <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> were no leſſe <hi>moved</hi> with the <hi>generoſity</hi> of her <hi>courage,</hi> than <hi>mollified</hi> with <hi>compaſſion</hi> to ſee to what a point of <hi>Deſpair</hi> the unfaithfulneſs of <hi>Iphis</hi> had reduced the deplorable <hi>Serife:</hi> Their <hi>Eloquence</hi> beeing not able to form <hi>Conſolations</hi> powerfull enough to appeaſe ſuch vehement <hi>Sorrow,</hi> all they did was to chide <hi>Remonda</hi> for her indiſcreet babbling.</p>
               <p>By this time the <hi>Lamp</hi> of the <hi>Day</hi> beeing drawn neer his <hi>Occident,</hi> and beginning to give place unto the ſmaller <hi>Lights,</hi> which his <hi>abſence</hi> kindleth in the <hi>Firmament,</hi> arrived <hi>Lupicin, Antalcas, Fleurial</hi> and <hi>Manile,</hi> accompaning <hi>Calliante,</hi> who came from the fruitleſs ſearch of thoſe whom they had before their Eyes without knowing them. At this arrivall the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> renewed their attention to conſider this new <hi>Comicall</hi> Act, the beſt whereof was, that <hi>Calliante,</hi> who came with intention to deceive them, was himſelf deceived.</p>
               <p>By the complot betwixt him and <hi>Serife,</hi> at their parting in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> hee knew the fallacy wherewith ſhe had prepoſſeſſed the ſpirits of all the Company; But his return beeing unexpected, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> had not the leiſure to inform him ſpeedily enough of <hi>Arcade's</hi> folly, who by his laughing had betrayed all the grace of that ſubtile ſuppoſition. It was a double delight to ſee <hi>Calliante's</hi> Mine countermined; But there remained a great miſtake in the <hi>Gentlemen's</hi> Spirits, who took <hi>him</hi> for a <hi>Woman</hi> in <hi>Man's</hi> clothing, and that hee onely counterfeited a <hi>Man</hi>-like Countenance; on the contrary they believed <hi>Serife</hi> to bee a <hi>Man,</hi> who was really of the Sex they thought ſhee counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>
               <p>What worthy Penſill ſhall I borrow to delineate to the Life the new aſtoniſhment of <hi>Calliante</hi> at his approaching neer <hi>Serife?</hi> For, having left her in his <hi>Country-weeds,</hi> and finding her in that glorious attire, which ſhee had put on purpoſely to compleat the conqueſt of his thoughts, hee could hardly perſwade his fancy to believe it was the ſame <hi>Iphis,</hi> whom hee had left in the <hi>Forest.</hi> In a word, thoſe rich Ornaments gave ſo much advantage to <hi>Serife's</hi> Beauty, <hi>that</hi> they did
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51476:93"/> the Office of <hi>Wood</hi> in augmenting <hi>Calliante's</hi> Fire; which was ſuch, that loſing the knowledge of himſelf, and the remembrance of the Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age hee was to repreſent, hee remained a good while, his <hi>Eyes</hi> fixed on her <hi>Face</hi> without motion, as if hee had been raviſhed in a profound Extaſie; and reſigning the Function of his <hi>Tongue</hi> to his <hi>Eyes,</hi> hee was angry with <hi>Nature,</hi> that ſhee had given him but <hi>two</hi> to contemplate ſo many Marvells. On the other ſide the <hi>Country-men,</hi> his attendants, who were not accuſtomed to ſee ſuch eminent Beauties every Day, much leſs to bee viſited by them in their Cottages, were not without admiration. Whileſt they were in this maze, not knowing where to begin their Compliments, the <hi>Women</hi> who were as haſty to caſt the <hi>ſecret</hi> out of their <hi>Mouths,</hi> as a <hi>Spider</hi> off their <hi>Boſoms,</hi> put them out of pain: For, <hi>Belida</hi> to her <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>Merinda</hi> and <hi>Remonda</hi> to the reſt, had quickly related all that had paſſed ſince their going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and what the dolefull <hi>Serife</hi> had imparted to them of Her Diſaſters.</p>
               <p>This bred ſome compaſſion in their Hearts, and made them imagine that it was not without ſome particular <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that ſo many ſtrange Accidents in ſo ſhort time ſhould bee preſented to their ſight. In mean time <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> accoſting <hi>Calliante,</hi> after ſome common Diſcourſe, intelligible enough, told him ſoftly <hi>Arcade's</hi> fault, <hi>that</hi> hee might underſtand that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> knew him. <hi>How?</hi> ſaid hee, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>for</hi> Liante? <hi>No,</hi> replied Boleſlaus, <hi>but for</hi> Almeria, <hi>their diſcovery hath gone no further. If they know no more,</hi> anſwered Calliante, <hi>bid my</hi> Brother <hi>keep his Countenance, and the ſcene not ending yet, the</hi> Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes <hi>ſhall not be the onely deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To deſcribe the greeting of theſe two <hi>Lovers</hi> tranſveſted in <hi>Opinion,</hi> but in <hi>Effect,</hi> cloathed according to their <hi>Sexes,</hi> were a difficult task. For, <hi>Serife</hi> beeing deeply in <hi>Love</hi> with <hi>Calliante,</hi> never had ſo fair an opportunity of repreſenting her Paſſions to him with as much <hi>reality,</hi> as hee thought them full of <hi>diſſimulation:</hi> And <hi>Calliante</hi> feeling his Heart ſo ſtreightly bound by the Charms of <hi>Serife's</hi> graces, knew not what to think, nor with what expreſſions to diſcover his Reſentments. At length making uſe of the priviledge of the <hi>Deceipt</hi> which <hi>occaſion</hi> then offered him. He broke ſilence, ſaying: <hi>That, if it were a Conſolation to thoſe in miſery to finde their equalls in infelicity, hee might in ſome wiſe deem himſelf happy among his Diſaſters to have met with her: yet if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have been bitten by mad Dogs, do feele their rage re-doubled by the approach of ſuch as are affected with the ſame Diſeaſe, hee feared to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51476:93"/> exaſperate his by Communication, or (Maladies beeing contagious) to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his Afflictions by making known to her the juſt complaints which hee had to make against</hi> Iphis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> replied Serife, <hi>I believe our diſaſters are arrived to ſuch an height, that there can bee nothing added to their extremity;</hi> and if <hi>every thing which hath attained to its juſt plenitude is accuſtomed to diminiſh according to the courſe of</hi> Nature, <hi>me-think's in our</hi> Deſpair <hi>this glimpſe of</hi> Hope <hi>is yet remaining, that henceforwards wee ought to look for the</hi> Decreaſing <hi>of our Miſeries, ſince they cannot</hi> increaſe <hi>without augmenting to</hi> infinitie. <hi>Your ſeeking and mine tend both to the ſame end, though by different wayes; wee aim at the ſame</hi> Blank <hi>from ſeverall</hi> Stations. <hi>You lament the loſs of your</hi> Honour, <hi>wounded by the lightneſs of your</hi> Siſter, <hi>and I bemoan the</hi> Levitie <hi>of my</hi> Husband, <hi>who by a cruell</hi> Change <hi>doth unworthily abuſe my</hi> Loyalty. <hi>I am confident if without</hi> Paſſion <hi>you could compare one affliction with the other, you would bee conſtrained to judge in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (ah wretched favour!</hi>) and <hi>acknowledge that I am the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: But, it is hard, eſpecially in matters of Misfortune, for a Man to be an equitable</hi> Judge <hi>in his own cauſe, in regard a</hi> Straw <hi>in our own</hi> Eyes, <hi>or a ſcratch upon our</hi> Bodies, <hi>is more painfull to us than a</hi> Beam <hi>in the ſight, or a great wound in the</hi> Body <hi>of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwered Calliante, <hi>if all did run in the Race of</hi> Infelicity, <hi>every one would think hee were first at the</hi> End; <hi>For, there is no one living but eſteem's his own Misfortunes the greateſt in the</hi> World, <hi>and thence proceeds ſo many lamentable Complaints, wherewith the diſtreſſed fill the</hi> Aire. <hi>But this is a miſerable conteſtation, wherein it is more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to bee the</hi> Conquered <hi>than</hi> Conquerour; <hi>Nevertheleſs ſince in all things wee ſtrive to overcome by an innate deſire which wee cannot leave, but with our Lives; give mee leave to tell you,</hi> that <hi>if</hi> thoſe who loſe their means (<hi>as it paſſeth in ſome places for a Proverb</hi>) do loſe their Senſes, <hi>with what fury ought they to bee tranſported, who are robb'd of their</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>which all well-tempered</hi> Minds <hi>will alwayes prefer not onely before the favours of</hi> Fortune, <hi>but their own</hi> Lives? <hi>This make's mee run in this inraged manner through the</hi> World, <hi>ſeeking my</hi> Siſter, <hi>either to dip this Weapon in her Blood, if ſhee hath forgotten herſelf ſo far, as to diſhonour our</hi> Family <hi>by an irreparable fault, or to venture my own life with her</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher, <hi>who (I am informed) is your</hi> Husband.</p>
               <p>At theſe words, pronounced with an angry Tone and an haughty Countenance, <hi>Serife</hi> began to Stagger; and (as if one had plunged a <hi>Dagger</hi> in her <hi>Heart</hi>) Shee let her ſelf ſink down betwixt the beloved
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51476:94"/> Arms of <hi>Calliante,</hi> who never received ſo acceptable a burthen; as ſhee never ſwounded with ſo much delight. This <hi>Fainting</hi> was beyond <hi>Jeſt,</hi> proceeding not from <hi>Sorrow,</hi> but the exceſs of <hi>Contentment,</hi> which tranſported her at the <hi>Preſence</hi> of an <hi>Object</hi> dearer to her than the whole <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> beſides: yet the aſperſion of a little cool Water upon her Face recalled her <hi>Spirits</hi> from that amorous traunce. As an Infant ſleeping betwixt it's Nurſe's Arms, doth open leiſurely it's little Eyes, when ſhee ſpurts out of her Breſts ſome drops of Milk upon its Face; ſo gracefully did <hi>Serife</hi> uncloſe her's, feeling her Cheeks bedewed with ſome Tears, which <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> had ſqueezed out of <hi>Calliante's</hi> Eyes, beeing troubled at this unexpected Accident.</p>
               <p>This tempeſt beeing paſt, <hi>Calliante</hi> fell into another, beeing aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides with the Reproaches and Accuſations of the Aſſiſtants, for having raiſed that Storm, which blaſted all the Flowers that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo Lively, and ſo Lovely in that <hi>Ladie's</hi> Countenance. <hi>Alas!</hi> ſaid hee, carrying Compaſſion in his Looks, <hi>perſecute mee no more for a fault, which hath brought it's Repentance with it, and for which I crave this vertuous</hi> Ladie's <hi>and the whole Companie's Pardon. I confeſs that my indiſcreet Expreſſions did hurry her even to the threſhold of</hi> Death, <hi>but I am ſo ſorry for having reduced her to that extremity,</hi> that <hi>I proteſt by the</hi> Beauty <hi>of her</hi> Eyes, (<hi>whoſe light I ſhall ever hereafter moſt inviolably honour) to belie thoſe audacious Words by contrary Effects, turning the fury of my</hi> Paſſion <hi>againſt my</hi> Siſter <hi>and my own</hi> Blood, <hi>and re-gain</hi> Her <hi>the poſſeſſion of that</hi> Husband, <hi>whoſe</hi> diſloyalty <hi>rendereth him unworthy of her</hi> Merits, <hi>and whom, notwithstanding, ſhee ſeem's ſo paſſionately to affect.</hi>

                  <hi>Courteous Sir,</hi> replied Serife, <hi>as your firſt ſpeeches precipitated mee into the pit of</hi> Death, <hi>this ſecond give's mee a deſire to</hi> Live. <hi>But have a care to verifie your words if you will have mee eſteem you a</hi> Gentleman <hi>of</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid Calliante, <hi>if</hi> Death <hi>prevent mee not in the attempt, I will exactly perform my Promiſe; For, I had rather loſe my</hi> Life, <hi>than ſtain my</hi> Honour <hi>with the breach of my</hi> Word. <hi>A more ſenſible affront cannot be done to any</hi> Man, <hi>than that which our</hi> Family <hi>receiveth from your</hi> Husband; <hi>but I remit the</hi> Vengeance <hi>to</hi> Heaven, <hi>and lay my interest at your</hi> Feet, <hi>reſolving to exerciſe my</hi> Indignation <hi>onely againſt that unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed</hi> Girle, <hi>who hath ſuffered herſelf to be abuſed by him. and who by her</hi> indiſcretion <hi>hath blemiſhed the honour of our Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you forgive my</hi> Husband, <hi>for</hi> Heaven's <hi>ſake and my conſideration, with all my</hi> Heart <hi>I pardon</hi> Almeria <hi>th' offence which ſhee hath committed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51476:94"/> againſt mee. But if</hi> Courteſie (<hi>the</hi> Queen <hi>of gentile</hi> Spirits, <hi>like your's) hath any aſcendant over your</hi> Heart, <hi>I conjure you to let it plead for</hi> Mee, <hi>and obtain the</hi> Favour <hi>which I ſhall demand of you. Demand not,</hi> Madam, <hi>anſwered,</hi> Calliante, <hi>but Command; For, I eſteem it as great a</hi> glory <hi>to obey you, as I ſhould bee ſenſible of</hi> ſhame <hi>to refuſe you any thing, were it to the hazard not onely of my</hi> Fortunes, <hi>but of my</hi> Life <hi>and</hi> Honour. <hi>I do not uſe to make any ſuch Reſervations, when I tender my ſervices to</hi> Ladies <hi>of your</hi> Quality, <hi>eſpecially when they are accompained with ſuch</hi> Vertue <hi>and</hi> Graces <hi>as you poſſeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> replied Serife, <hi>I am ſo far from deſiring any thing prejudiciall to your</hi> Fortunes, Honour <hi>or</hi> Life, that <hi>clean-contrary I Study the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them all together, beſeeching you to pardon your</hi> Siſter, <hi>and not to execute any</hi> Vengeance <hi>upon Her Perſon; Shee is your own</hi> Fleſh <hi>and</hi> Blood, <hi>and (as it were) another ſelf. Why do I ſay another</hi> Self? <hi>Theſe Shepherdeſſes (who have ſeen you both) tell mee, that one drop of</hi> Water <hi>is leſs like another than you two, ſo that you ſeem not onely to bee</hi> Twins, <hi>but the ſame</hi> Perſon; <hi>there beeing none living able to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, and that would not take</hi> Her <hi>for</hi> Calliante <hi>if ſhee were in your Cloathes, and</hi> you <hi>for</hi> Almeria <hi>if</hi> you <hi>were in</hi> Her's. <hi>For (which</hi> Heavens <hi>forbid) if in the heat of your</hi> Paſſion <hi>you ſhould dip your</hi> Hands <hi>in the</hi> Blood <hi>of that miſerable Creature, who could exempt you from expiating that</hi> Parricide <hi>by the loſs of your</hi> Honour, Life <hi>and</hi> Fortunes, <hi>I ſay, by the proſecution of</hi> humane <hi>Juſtice? which though you ſhould finde means to eſcape, would not the</hi> Divine, (<hi>think you) perſecute you through all the corners of the</hi> Earth, <hi>whither your</hi> guilt <hi>would make you wander (like a deſperate Oreſtes) without finding any repoſe for your</hi> Conſcience, <hi>which would be agitated with a thouſand</hi> Furies, <hi>the</hi> Voyce <hi>of</hi> Blood <hi>crying out inceſſantly for</hi> Vengeance <hi>of your</hi> Crime?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calliante</hi> feining to bee overcome by her conjuring Speech, made appear <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Poet's</hi> fictions were not without reaſon, when they made <hi>Love</hi> diſarm the <hi>God</hi> of War, and ſnatch the <hi>Thunder</hi> out of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> Hand; For, caſting all his <hi>Poyſon</hi> under the beautifull <hi>Serife's</hi> feet, hee proteſted <hi>that hee would do no violence to the perſon of</hi> Iphis, <hi>nor vent his Paſſion againſt</hi> Almeria, <hi>but would continue loving</hi> Her <hi>as</hi> Himſelf, <hi>and honour</hi> Him <hi>in the perſon of that</hi> Lady, <hi>under whoſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee reſolved to Live and Die.</hi> Thus the <hi>Peace</hi> was concluded, to the great contentment both of the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> &amp; <hi>Rusticks,</hi> who were as much amazed to ſee in ſo little time ſo great a change, as when a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> which fill's the <hi>Air</hi> with <hi>Thunder,</hi> &amp; ſtorms the <hi>Earth</hi> with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51476:95"/> 
                  <hi>Rain</hi> and horrid <hi>Hail,</hi> is ſodainly diſſipated, leaving the agreeable Rayes of the <hi>Sun</hi> in full liberty to inlighten thoſe that do behold them. It was as eaſie for <hi>Calliante</hi> to keep his Oath, as hard for him to break it; For, how could hee offend <hi>Iphis</hi> without injuring <hi>Serife,</hi> or take revenge of <hi>Almeria</hi> without turning his fury upon himſelf? So, they all agreed to terminate amiably this memorable adventure, and rather to employ the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> than the <hi>Vineger</hi> of <hi>Enmity</hi> for the healing of their imaginary wounds.</p>
               <p>Their Converſation beeing ended with the Day, <hi>Serife</hi> remained with <hi>Celian's</hi> Daughters, whileſt <hi>Calliante</hi> and the other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> retired themſelves with their <hi>Ruſtick</hi> Attendants to their Lodging. Mony beeing not ſpared, there was great cheer on all ſides; For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Preſents which <hi>Serife</hi> beſtowed on <hi>Celian,</hi> and his Daughters, <hi>Calliante</hi> was no leſs liberall to his Aſſiſtants, who promiſed him a thouſand ſervices for his generoſity to them. As it is the cuſtome of <hi>Peaſants</hi> in all places to drink freely, eſpecially in the <hi>Septentrionall</hi> Countries, theſe ſpent the beſt part of the <hi>Night</hi> at that exerciſe; in ſo much that the <hi>Sun</hi> was already well advanced in his <hi>Diurnall</hi> courſe, before their <hi>Eyes</hi> were capable of diſcovering his <hi>Light.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they were buryed in that Liquor, the abundance whereof ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth <hi>Sleep,</hi> no leſs than the juyce of <hi>Poppies,</hi> our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> had full leiſure to entertain <hi>Calliante,</hi> who acting the modeſt <hi>Virgin</hi> before them, made ſhew of a certain baſhfulneſs, which argued nothing of a looſe Life; For, perſons given over to <hi>Impudicity,</hi> do commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the quality of <hi>Impudence;</hi> So that they knew not how to judge lightly of her, whom they ſaw ſo extreamly reſerved; And this was the onely part <hi>Calliante</hi> had now to play, to make them ſtill take him for <hi>Almeria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then falling upon the Diſcourſe of the paſſionate Affection hee expreſſed to <hi>Serife,</hi> the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> told her that they could not but admire to ſee the <hi>chance</hi> ſo turned, <hi>that</hi> beeing now in <hi>Man's</hi> apparell ſhee ſeemed to bee exceſſively taken with <hi>Iphis,</hi> who ſome Dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received nothing but Marks of her Diſdain. Wherunto <hi>Calliante</hi> thus replied, <hi>I know not if thoſe Cloathes bee inchanted, but I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi> that <hi>ſince his change of Habit, my Heart is become ſo Linked to his</hi> perfections, <hi>that out of his Preſence I am like a</hi> Marrigold, <hi>which cloſeth when the</hi> Sun <hi>is ſet.</hi> The <hi>Countrey-men</hi> beeing riſen (to bee rid of their not much pleaſing Company) hee diſperſed them ſeverall wayes, to make further ſearch after the Fugitives, that they might not (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51476:95"/> travell up and down in vain as they had done the day before. They beeing gone upon this triviall errand, the converſation of the remaining Day was in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> under the delightfull ſhades, in the company of the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Sheperdeſſes;</hi> who thought they had made no little gain by the change of <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Almeria,</hi> for <hi>Calliante</hi> and <hi>Serife,</hi> meaſuring the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>Perſons</hi> by the <hi>profit</hi> which accrued to them. In this agreeable place, where the <hi>Shepheards</hi> uſed to lay their Nets for the innocent Beaſts, did our <hi>Gallants</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive inventions to deceive their ſimplicity. Here it was where thoſe who thought to ſurpriſe, were themſelves ſurpriſed, and where was acted the moſt pleaſant Piece of <hi>couſenage,</hi> that could bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>For, firſt, if you conſider the <hi>Shepherdeſſes,</hi> there was not one of them, but took <hi>Calliante</hi> and <hi>Serife</hi> for quite other perſons, than thoſe which had appeared before, under the Names of <hi>Almeria</hi> and <hi>Iphis.</hi> Next, if you look upon <hi>Calliante,</hi> though hee did the office of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi> hee was <hi>deceived</hi> no leſs than they, taking <hi>Serife</hi> to bee a <hi>Man,</hi> whom <hi>Nature</hi> had created otherwiſe; than the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who had diſguiſed themſelves to abuſe the <hi>Peaſant's</hi> Eyes, had their error alſo; For, they thought <hi>Calliante</hi> to bee a <hi>Woman,</hi> when hee was really what his habit ſpake him. Neither was <hi>Serife</hi> without a ſhare of miſtake, in that ſhee conceived <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Paſſion</hi> which <hi>Calliante</hi> expreſſed to her was feined, when his <hi>Tongue</hi> was a faithfull Interpreter of his <hi>Heart's</hi> ſincereſt thoughts. As for <hi>Calliante's</hi> Scouts, <hi>Lupicin</hi> and the reſt, their fruitleſs <hi>peregrination</hi> was a ſufficient teſtimony of their beeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly abuſed. Onely <hi>Celian</hi> was not deceived in his end, who ayming at nothing but to get what hee could on all ſides, found his account well enough; it was indifferent to him whether <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Almeria,</hi> or <hi>Calliante</hi> and <hi>Serife</hi> filled his Houſe, ſo that his Purſe was filled hee cared no further.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the compaſſionate <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> indeavour to comfort the deſolate <hi>Lady,</hi> with the hope they gave her of ſhortly ſeeing again her Husband, in regard there were ſo many Meſſengers well acquainted with all the paſſages of that <hi>Foreſt,</hi> ſent ſeverall wayes to ſeek him, ſhe ſighed for an <hi>Object</hi> preſent in <hi>Body,</hi> but whom ſhee thought abſent in <hi>Heart,</hi> not deeming herſelf to bee the abſolute <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of his deſires. And as by inſtinct of <hi>Nature</hi> every one is apt to lay his Hand on the Sore, or to the place where he feeleth pain, they were no ſooner ſeated under the favourable covert of a fair <hi>Sicomore</hi> Tree, whoſe root was
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51476:96"/> watered with the <hi>Chryſtall</hi> of a cleer <hi>Fountain,</hi> but <hi>Serife</hi> began to rip up the remembrance of her diſgrace. What <hi>Lenitives</hi> ſoever the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants indeavored to apply, it ſeemed as if the <hi>anguiſh</hi> of her <hi>wound</hi> was augmented by their <hi>remedies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calliante</hi> and the other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> alleadged many exquiſite <hi>reaſons,</hi> and acute <hi>Arguments,</hi> to convince her obſtinate grieving, which would much imbelliſh this <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> if I did not fear to ſpin it out too far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my meaſure. I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to remark only this pretty accident which interrupted their diſcourſe: It was the plaintive chanting of a <hi>Turtle-Dove,</hi> who having choſen her ſeat upon a wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtump among thoſe Leaves, began to ſalute their Ears with a tone ſo dolefull, that it would have moved <hi>Compaſſion</hi> in <hi>Souls</hi> leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of <hi>pitty;</hi> which gave occaſion to <hi>Serife</hi> to return it theſe words: <hi>Pittifull Bird, the living Emblem of my condition, thou comeſt very opportunely to preſent thy ſelf to my view, and teach mee to bemoan, in an accent, like thine, the Miſeries that afflict mee. Thou makest us ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently underſtand, that thou haſt loſt thy Mate, either by the cruell ſtroak of</hi> Death, <hi>or ſome ſiniſter ſtraying; and thy</hi> Groans <hi>reverberating the</hi> Eccho's <hi>of theſe Woods, ſeem either to recall him to Life, or to carry</hi> him <hi>news of</hi> thee; <hi>to the end by his return</hi> thou <hi>maist give o're</hi> complaining. <hi>Sweet</hi> Dove, <hi>thou haſt no</hi> Gall, <hi>neither haſt thou any need of it; For, thou art aſſured that his unfaithfullneſs will never give</hi> thee <hi>cauſe to expreſs any</hi> anger. Alas! <hi>I am not ſo perfect, nor ſo happy, for the</hi> jealouſie <hi>which devour's mee, take's away all ſenſe of</hi> ſweetneſs, <hi>and make's mee hate to live, by reaſon of the</hi> inconſtancy <hi>of</hi> him, <hi>who hath made mee ſo many deep Proteſtations never to be capable of</hi> diſloyalty. <hi>Go pretty</hi> Pigeon, <hi>and ſince I have Married my Accents with thine, direct thy ſpeedy Wings towards the place where my perfidious</hi> Iphis <hi>now is, and if thou canſt not make him conſider the</hi> torment <hi>which his</hi> ingratitude <hi>cauſeth mee to ſuffer, make him aſhamed by thy</hi> preſence, <hi>and let him ſee that</hi> Men (<hi>more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in their irregular diſpoſitions than</hi> Animals <hi>which have no</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) <hi>may learn of them Leſſons of</hi> Fidelity <hi>and</hi> Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Shee had continued longer in this mournfull ſtrain, if <hi>Calliante</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fear leſt the exceſs of <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhould tranſport her into ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly extravagance, had not broke off her Speech, telling her, <hi>that</hi> to talk to <hi>Birds,</hi> and to ſow upon the <hi>Sands,</hi> were things equally abſurd; <hi>That</hi> ſhee ought to hope for better <hi>Fortune,</hi> and take the conſolation which is commonly given to young <hi>Widdowes,</hi> which is, <hi>that by the loſs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51476:96"/> of one Husband they may have the choyce of divers others.</hi> And beeing of a Joviall Diſpoſition, eſpecially in theſe delightfull Recreations, having a greater deſire to paſs his time in <hi>Laughing</hi> than <hi>Lamenting,</hi> he fancied an Air to ſome Lines, in anſwer (as hee ſaid) of the <hi>Turtle's</hi> mournfull Tune.

                  <hi>Calliante</hi> finding this concluſion favourable to his <hi>Deſign,</hi> interrupted her Singing with theſe words: <hi>Madam,</hi> Nature <hi>hath indued our Souls with a certain inſtinct which inclineth us to the preſervation of our ſelves, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by</hi> Perſons <hi>that are drowning, who lay hold on any thing they can reach to ſave their</hi> Lives. <hi>Some few dayes ſince</hi> you <hi>and I, without</hi> Reaſon <hi>or</hi> Conſideration, <hi>did run to finde out</hi> Rocks, <hi>where (according to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the</hi> Paſſions <hi>which blinded us) wee could expect no leſs than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable</hi> Shipwrack: <hi>But the juſt</hi> Heavens (<hi>which favour good intentions) have not permitted us to fall into thoſe</hi> Precipices, <hi>quite contrary, in having made us known to each other, it ſeem's that they have imitated the</hi> Earth, <hi>which produceth no venimous</hi> Plant, <hi>but hath ordered i'ts</hi> Antidote <hi>to grow neer it, if wee have the skill to diſtinguiſh them. For, if wee manage aright the</hi> occaſion <hi>that is now preſented to us, wee may reap great</hi> Advantage <hi>by our</hi> Loſs, <hi>and draw an extream</hi> Satisfaction <hi>from the</hi> Center <hi>of our</hi> Afflictions, <hi>as the pureſt</hi> Pearls, <hi>which are ſo clear and ſmooth, are taken out of black and rugged</hi> Shells.</p>
               <p>Then, to create a belief that ſhee ſhould finde a more ſolid and firm ſupporter of him than ſhee fancied, hee made her a ſummary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> (as hee had done before in <hi>Celian's</hi> Houſe, when hee ſo handſomly cheated all that heard him) adding ſome circumſtances, and ſo quaintly contriv'd Expreſſions, <hi>that</hi> the moſt ſcrupulous of the aſſiſtants could hardly believe their <hi>Eyes,</hi> their <hi>Ears</hi> were ſo ſurpriſed. It is true, beeing touched to the quick, hee ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his Diſcourſe with ſo paſſionate an Action, that it was eaſie to diſcern hee had much intereſt in thoſe paſſages; Which was taken diverſly by the <hi>Shepherdeſſes, Courtiers, Serife</hi> and Himſelf. In ſumme, upon this laſt Reſolution, the <hi>Sun</hi> beginning to make <hi>Night</hi> by the far extending of his <hi>Shades,</hi> they retired to the Village; the two <hi>Lovers</hi> more inamored than ſatisfied of each other, becauſe, for divers reſpects, they durſt not manifeſt their Reſentments; The <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi> not very well pleaſed with the <hi>Ladie's</hi> ſodain change, who therein ſhewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more <hi>Woman</hi> than they could have wiſhed for the <hi>Honour</hi> of their <hi>Sex,</hi> and the <hi>Courtiers</hi> full of admiration at the dexterous conduct of this Plot, whereinto they penetrated no farther than half way.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey had not been long returned to their Village, before the weary Swains came dropping in from ſeverall parts, as wiſe as when they went out; yet every one, not to appear an unprofitable Servant, made his <hi>report,</hi> which came as neer to the <hi>truth</hi> as <hi>white</hi> to <hi>black,</hi> and had as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to each other. For, ſome promiſed him the next day to bring him certain tydings where the Fugitives were; others deſpaired of ever finding them; like the Scouts of the <hi>Iſraëlites,</hi> whereof ſome diſcouraged the <hi>People</hi> from entring into the Land of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> others made them believe wonders to animate them to that glorious Conqueſt. There was nothing to bee talked of, but to provide good cheer for thoſe hungry <hi>Seekers.</hi> who had loſt their labour in following a <hi>Shadow</hi> and imbracing the <hi>Winde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Evening paſſed, not without many Proteſtations of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable affection betwixt <hi>Calliante</hi> and <hi>Serife,</hi> each ſtriving in cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his companion to deceive himſelf. Their diſcourſe for ſome time was in private, where (after ſome laughter at the ſimplicity of thoſe whom they had abuſed) <hi>ſaid</hi> Calliante, <hi>Amongſt all this</hi> jeaſting <hi>wee may be caught our ſelves in</hi> earneſt. <hi>For, I protest,</hi> Brother (ſaid hee in her Ear) <hi>thou doſt act</hi> Serife <hi>ſo admirably, that I cannot take thee for</hi> Iphis, <hi>and I conſume within myſelf by an unknown</hi> Paſſion, <hi>which give's mee a cruell</hi> torment, <hi>but ſuch a</hi> torment, <hi>that I had rather bee cured by the hand of</hi> Death, <hi>than uſe the means which the</hi> Tempter <hi>propoſeth to mee.

                  <hi>So much,</hi> anſwered Serife, <hi>that against the advantages which</hi> Nature <hi>giveth to the condition of</hi> Men, <hi>you make mee almoſt deſire to bee a</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>that I might poſſeſs you intirely, and under the Lawes of</hi> Hymen <hi>bee perfectly</hi> yours. <hi>But,</hi> Brother, <hi>Is it poſſible that you can jeer ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly at my ſimplicity, and that you are ſo Artificiall as ſtill to continue your diſſimulation before mee, who plainly perceive your policy? Thoſe Heats of the</hi> Liver <hi>which your Speech diſcover's, reſemble the</hi> Surges <hi>that appear in the Sea ſome time after the</hi> Winds <hi>are down, and the</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt <hi>of the</hi> Air <hi>ceaſed, as marks of it's</hi> anger, <hi>and precedent</hi> agitation. <hi>You think (I believe) that thoſe</hi> Gentlemen <hi>and</hi> Shepherdeſſes <hi>underſtand what you ſay, not conſidering that you speak particularly to mee, and that you are heard by no other Ears than mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do not uſe to be ſo raviſhed from my ſelf,</hi> replyed Calliante, that <hi>I cannot ſee to whom and before whom I ſpeak, and by calling you,</hi> Brother, <hi>you may well judge that I preſuppoſe no body hear's mee but your ſelf, and therefore I now unmask myſelf to you, aſſuring you that if under the ſimple habit of a</hi> Shepherdeſs <hi>you appeared to my Eyes no leſs beautifull than an</hi> Angell, <hi>under the Ornaments wherewith you are now attired, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth ſo tranſport my ſenſes</hi> that <hi>I may well forget that you are a</hi> Man, <hi>ſince miſtaking my ſelf I know not what I am, nor by conſequent what I either ſay or do I feel a dizzineſs of</hi> Brain <hi>which ſo disturbeth my</hi> Reaſon, <hi>that if you alter not ſpeedily the</hi> Scene, <hi>I ſhall bee overcome with theſe</hi> Illuſions, <hi>and fall into the ſtrangeſt</hi> Frenſie <hi>that ever poſſeſſed a</hi> Spirit <hi>diverſly agitated.</hi>

It is true <hi>that</hi> as that <hi>Sex</hi> is ſubject to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, it is incapable of ſodain and violent Enterpriſes; beſides, <hi>Ladies</hi> are generally of that diſpoſition, not to yeild without ſome ſhew of compulſion, even in things where they are leſt of all forced. I can aſſure you, how diſpleaſed ſoever ſhee ſeem's, and whatſoever ſhee ſaith to the contrary, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Rape</hi> which I intend will bee attended by her own <hi>Conſent,</hi> which will bee a ſufficient juſtification for my action and your aſſiſtance.

               <p>This was no ſooner moved, but reſolved. <hi>Calliante</hi> having diſpoſed them to this attempt, diſcovered preſently the deſign to the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to the end they ſhould oppoſe the carrying away of <hi>Serife,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> their oppoſition might make another <hi>Scene</hi> of Merriment, which will have an <hi>Exit</hi> contrary to what hee imagined. The <hi>Swains</hi> of neceſſity muſt communicate this Plot to the <hi>Shepherdeſſes,</hi> in regard they were to bee inſtrumentall to the effecting of it. But hee that tell's a Secret to three <hi>Women</hi> muſt not look to have it long kept Secret. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently revealed it to their <hi>Father,</hi> that hee might not be ſurpriſed with that action. But Hee, who loved the <hi>preſent</hi> better than the <hi>future,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> better than <hi>Promiſes,</hi> did not approve of that enterpriſe, which beſides it's injuſtice, and beeing ſubject to many diſaſters, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him of his dear Gueſts, who yeilded him more profit in a week,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51476:104"/> than hee could get by his tillage in a Year; So that, partly out of <hi>Prudence,</hi> partly for his private <hi>intereſt,</hi> hee abſolutely refuſed his conſent, commanding <hi>Merinda</hi> to advertiſe <hi>Serife,</hi> that ſhee might ſtand upon her Guard; this Office <hi>Merinda</hi> would have performed without his injunction; For, her <hi>Heart</hi> was ſo oppreſſed with that Secret, that ſhee had reſolved to disburden it by her <hi>Tongue,</hi> whatſoever befell.</p>
               <p>At this newes <hi>Serife</hi> counterfeited ſuch amazement, <hi>that</hi> ſhee ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a while, as if <hi>Fear</hi> had been carrying her <hi>Soul</hi> out of her <hi>Body;</hi> at length having ſomewhat recollected her Spirits, with a trembling voyce ſhee ſaid; <hi>To what a degree of</hi> Miſery <hi>doth</hi> Fortune <hi>reduce mee, ſince ſhee perſecute's mee ſo cruelly,</hi> that <hi>in the ſame</hi> Port <hi>where</hi> Hope <hi>promiſed me</hi> Security, <hi>Shee make's mee ſuffer</hi> Shipwrack? <hi>What? muſt I then follow thoſe I ought to ſhun, and fly from thoſe who promiſed mee all aſſiſtance?

               <p>Madam, <hi>anſwered</hi> Merinda, <hi>by</hi> Heaven's <hi>favour, you ſhall not be put to any ſuch extremity: For, if my</hi> Father <hi>expreſly forbid's my</hi> Brothers <hi>and their</hi> Companions <hi>to act any thing againſt your</hi> Perſon, <hi>the</hi> contriver <hi>of this</hi> Plot <hi>will reap nothing but the</hi> Shame <hi>of having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it,</hi> and <hi>you ſhall be free from the</hi> Diſpleaſure <hi>his</hi> unadviſedneſs <hi>would have cauſed to your Thoughts. Serife</hi> knowing that it was the powder of injection, which made the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> favour that Project, to trie their Diſpoſitions, and tempt them by feeling their Pulſes on both ſides, having put ſome ſmall Chains of <hi>Gold</hi> into the <hi>Shepherdeſſes</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:51476:105"/> Hands, to make them Bracelets; and ſhewing them ſeverall rich jewells, ſhee promiſed them, <hi>that</hi> thoſe ſhould bee the meaneſt Recompences of their fidelity, if by their means that ſtorme blew over her Head; giving them beſides, ſome pieces of <hi>Gold</hi> to hinder <hi>Celian</hi> to keep his Sons in order, and ſome to bee diſtributed among them; Hereupon they became like that corrupt <hi>Judge,</hi> who cauſed a <hi>Coach</hi> (which a <hi>Client</hi> had given him to pronounce ſentence in his favour) to bee drawn by <hi>Horſes</hi> of a greater value, which the <hi>adverſe Party</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him.</p>
               <p>Whileſt this was in agitation on one ſide, <hi>Pomeran</hi> (who was, as wee have ſaid, jealous of the <hi>Palatin's</hi> Honour, and who did not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliſh his Paſſion for <hi>Almeria</hi>) entertained in his thoughts the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt imagination that could bee deviſed: <hi>Hee</hi> fancied that <hi>Serife</hi> had an intent to marry <hi>Calliante</hi> under that diſguiſe, and it beeing done and paſt all remedy, <hi>that</hi> (hee reſuming the habit of <hi>Palatine</hi>) would laugh at their ſimplicity, as well as the Country-People's. Therefore out of a deſire to oblige <hi>Mieſlas</hi> and <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> and (as hee thought) <hi>I phigenes</hi> himſelf (as thoſe do a courteſie to poor Creatures that are frantick, who take the pains to binde them, although they raile and exclaim all the while they are tying) Hee thought it very requiſite, <hi>that</hi> Hee with his two companions and <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> ſhould oppoſe in good <hi>Earneſt</hi> that <hi>Imaginary</hi> Rape; and to the end they might the more ſecurely effect their intention, it was not held improper to require the <hi>Justice</hi> of the Place's ſuccour.</p>
               <p>The Evening beeing come, every one ſtood upon his Guard; <hi>Serife</hi> not onely ſtirred not abroad, but refuſed the entrance of her Chamber to <hi>Calliante; Celian</hi> watched like the <hi>Heſperian</hi> Dragon over his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; His <hi>Daughters</hi> were ſet Sentinells, to call for help upon the leaſt allarm; the <hi>Swains</hi> beeing overcome by the Commands of <hi>Celian,</hi> and preſents which <hi>Serife</hi> ſent them, pretended difficulties, and ſtood ſtill with their Arms acroſs; and the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> were reſolved to preſerve <hi>Serife;</hi> Hereupon <hi>Calliante</hi> feining to bee in an exceſſive Rage, fell to vaporing with the Country-men, thundred out divers threats againſt their baſeneſs, called them treacherous Villains for failing him in the onely time hee had need of their help, and vomited all the bittereſt tearms that Deſpair doth uſe to ſuggeſt in like occurrences.</p>
               <p>But the houre of Reſt ſummoning them to retire, they all continued for a while in a ſad <hi>ſilence,</hi> every one allowing the <hi>more</hi> liberty to his Thoughts, the <hi>leſs</hi> hee gave his Tongue; untill <hi>Pomeran,</hi> eſteeming it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51476:105"/> neceſſary, to ſpeak in that extremity, thus began; Almeria, <hi>it is now time to quit that</hi> Mask, <hi>we are not</hi> Men <hi>to be cheated as you imagine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> your ſelf <hi>with having raviſhed the</hi> Heart <hi>of</hi> Iphis <hi>by the</hi> Charms, <hi>which his</hi> Paſſion <hi>make's him finde in that little</hi> Beauty, <hi>which appeareth in your</hi> Face, <hi>and ſeek not to rob his legitimate</hi> Spouſe <hi>of his</hi> Body; <hi>He cannot be</hi> yours <hi>untill his firſt bonds be diſſolved, which he hath ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolemnly ſworn never to violate; greater</hi> Ladies, <hi>than</hi> you <hi>can ever hope to be, pretend to his alliance, if that firſt</hi> Marriage <hi>could be declared void. Do not think to inchant us, or ſurpriſe the</hi> Palatine <hi>by your artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi> Stratagems; <hi>For, we are reſolved with the perill of incurring his</hi> diſ-favour, <hi>and loſing our own</hi> Lives, <hi>couragiouſly to hinder your</hi> Deſign <hi>of making your ſelf his</hi> Wife; <hi>be ſatisfied with the part you have in his</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>without aſpiring farther, unleſs you have a</hi> minde <hi>to ſee a ſtrange diſorder, and</hi> humane Juſtice <hi>as well as the</hi> Divine <hi>oppoſed againſt your</hi> Practiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calliante</hi> concluded by this Diſcourſe, pronounced with a grave and ſettled Countenance, that <hi>Pomeran</hi> was ſeriouſly and really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Therefore to intangle him the faſter in his Net, hee replied: <q>My <hi>Honour</hi> is ſo deeply ingaged in this buſineſs, <hi>that</hi> I muſt die or bring it to <hi>perfection,</hi> nothing but <hi>Marriage</hi> can make mee <hi>Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Iphis</hi> hath plighted mee his <hi>Faith,</hi> beeing in full capacity of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding &amp; Self-diſpoſall,</hi> whereas that which you pretend was forced, <hi>and</hi> in an <hi>Age</hi> ſo tender, <hi>that</hi> he knew not what hee promiſed; therefore I maintain <hi>that</hi> hee is more <hi>Mine</hi> than <hi>Modeſtina's,</hi> and <hi>Iphis</hi> is able to juſtifie his ingagement to <hi>Mee</hi> in deſpight of all <hi>your</hi> indeavours <hi>and</hi> contradictions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe expreſſions were like <hi>Oyle</hi> caſt upon the <hi>Fire</hi> of that Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was kindled in the <hi>Genlemen's</hi> Hearts. So they grew to high <hi>Words,</hi> then to <hi>Threats,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Exclamations; Iphis</hi> was named aloud, <hi>Almeria</hi> likewiſe. Hereupon the Country-men that were in the next room, ſending their looks through the crannies, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ears to the Wall, ſuſpected there was ſome deceipt in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſement of thoſe unknown perſons; and <hi>Antalcas</hi> reflecting upon <hi>Serife's</hi> reſemblance of <hi>Iphis,</hi> and beſides hearing <hi>Calliante</hi> called by the Name of <hi>Almeria,</hi> hee preſently concluded that <hi>Calliante</hi> was ALMERIA and <hi>Serife</hi> IPHIS, which filled thoſe <hi>Ruſtick's</hi> Heads with ſuch ſtrange imaginations, that no ſleep could ſeize upon them for that Night.</p>
               <p>Scarce had the baſhfull Harbinger of the Day ſaluted the edge of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51476:106"/> the <hi>Horizon,</hi> when <hi>Pomeran</hi> (who had not cloſed his Eyes) leaving his Companions as Guards upon <hi>Calliante,</hi> went to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the place to require ſuccour for the preventing of a violence intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Lady</hi> of quality. The Officers of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in villages are a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſort of People; For, <hi>Ignorance</hi> having predominance there, the <hi>Dominicall</hi> Letter is leſs known than the <hi>Golden</hi> Number, ſo that their <hi>Rule</hi> is <hi>Mony,</hi> and the <hi>Levell</hi> of their <hi>Juſtice</hi> is this <hi>Maxime</hi> of Law-Makers, <hi>I give thee 'cauſe thou givest mee,</hi> and <hi>Do thou for mee, and I'le do for thee.</hi> The Springs which make this Engine move are of quick-<hi>Silver,</hi> The firſt thing they ask is, <hi>who is Plaintif?</hi> the next, <hi>who muſt pay us?</hi> and before hand, like true Executioners of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Thoſe petty <hi>Tribunalls</hi> are the ruine of the People; and whereas true <hi>Juſtice</hi> is <hi>to give every Man his own,</hi> Theſe have the trick to rob every one of what hee hath: For, thoſe thirſty Leaches ſuck indifferently the <hi>good</hi> blood and the <hi>bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomeran</hi> having ſpared nothing that might induce theſe to aſſiſt him in that Action (which hee thought very important) they went, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Orator ſaid, to a <hi>Golden</hi> harveſt. <hi>First</hi> they ſeized upon <hi>Calliante</hi> and the <hi>Ruſticks,</hi> charging <hi>Celian</hi> with <hi>Serife,</hi> ſeeming in this execution as inflexible as <hi>Rhadamanthus:</hi> But it is ſufficiently known <hi>that</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> one hand rubb's the other as well as in <hi>Citties, that</hi> partly by intereſt, partly by <hi>Favour,</hi> and for reſpects of <hi>Parentage,</hi> the Eyes of <hi>Juſtice</hi> are uſually blinded, as the brightneſs of the <hi>Sun</hi> is dimmed by the interpoſition of Miſts and Clowds. In what part ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it bee, a <hi>Stranger</hi> is alwayes more to blame than an <hi>inhabitant</hi> of the place. The <hi>Country men</hi> onely ſaluted the in-ſide of the <hi>Priſon,</hi> and were preſently releaſed upon <hi>Baile,</hi> but <hi>Calliante</hi> found that place according to the deſcription of the pious <hi>Trojan's</hi> deſcent into <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> where the entrance was eaſie, but the coming out very difficult. Such are the Scales of humane judgements, while one is up the other is down, never even.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ruſticks</hi> incenſed with this affront, and ſufficiently inſtructed by what they had heard the Night before, of the Cheat which had been put upon them, reſolved to bee revenged, and to that end preſented a Petition to their <hi>Juſtice,</hi> deſiring <hi>that</hi> thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and the <hi>Lady</hi> alſo might bee impriſoned, urging <hi>that</hi> they were perſons diſguiſed, and who under habits different from thoſe of their condition, were come thither to plot and ingage them in ſome dangerous Deſigne; Moreover, <hi>that</hi> they had aſſumed habits contrary to their <hi>Sexes</hi> againſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51476:106"/> the Lawes of the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> upon farther ſearch it would appear, that <hi>Calliante</hi> was a <hi>Woman</hi> and <hi>Serife</hi> a <hi>Man;</hi> which, they ſaid, they would maintain with the hazard of loſing their Lives and Goods. This put their wiſe <hi>Judges</hi> to a <hi>Nor-plus,</hi> yet they were not much troubled at it; For, ſeeing theſe contradictions they promiſed themſelves good Fiſhing in that troubled Water, and as the <hi>Raven</hi> in the <hi>Fable,</hi> ſeeing a <hi>Dog</hi> and a <hi>Wolf</hi> fighting, ſaid, <hi>that</hi> whoſoever had the Victory, hee ſhould bee ſure of a prey; So, by this Debate they hoped to fill their Purſes, beeing reſolved to take with both Hands.</p>
               <p>Herupon Order was given for the ſecuring of their perſons; The <hi>Commons</hi> of the Village aſſembled in ſuch multitudes, <hi>that</hi> what could three or foure <hi>Gentlemen</hi> do in ſuch an hubbub, unleſs by reſiſting, make themſelves bee Butchered by ignoble Hands? Beſides, <hi>Serife</hi> (who willingly ſubmitted herſelf) making them ſigns to do the like; flattering herſelf <hi>that</hi> only by pronouncing the name of IPHIGENES, ſhee ſhould diſſipate all that <hi>rabble,</hi> as a great <hi>Eagle</hi> Scatter's a flight of <hi>Pigeons</hi> when ſhee ſtoops among them.</p>
               <p>To bee ſhort, they were all Apprehended and Committed, but to ſeverall rooms, which troubled <hi>Serife</hi> not a little (who thought ſhee ſhould have been put with <hi>Calliante</hi>) and caſt the reſt of the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> into ſtrange perplexities; And <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> (though hee ſpake not all hee thought) could not refrain from ſaying as hee paſſed by <hi>Serife:</hi> Madam, <hi>you ſee into what troubles your</hi> Paſſion <hi>hath brought us, now it concern't you to take your meaſure ſo as to draw us out of this</hi> Dungeon <hi>by your</hi> power, <hi>whereinto wee are caſt for your</hi> Pleaſure. <hi>Serife</hi> knew not well conſtrue theſe words of <hi>Boleſlaüs;</hi> For, reſpecting his wiſdom as ſhee ought, having alwayes found her ſucceſs as evill when ſhee rejected his Counſells, as advantageous when ſhee followed them, and gathering by his looks and tone of voyce, that hee ſpake ſeriouſly, her thoughts were in no ſmall perplexity by this allarm, which ſeem'd a preſage of the extremity ſhee ſhould ſuffer by that impriſonment. But the ſhort time ſhee had to reflect upon his advertiſement, and the violence of her deſire to bee with <hi>Calliante,</hi> cauſed the ballance of her judgement to incline to the worſt ſide, ſuffering herſelf to be immured in that <hi>labyrinth,</hi> whence thoſe <hi>Monſters</hi> (the corrupt formalities which ſo diſfigure the fair Face of <hi>Juſtice</hi>) oppoſed her inlargement more than ſhee imagined.</p>
               <p>Their examinations were taken ſeverally, which had as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51476:107"/> to each other, as the <hi>ſable</hi> Mantle of <hi>Night</hi> to the <hi>azure</hi> robe of <hi>Heaven</hi> in a clear <hi>Day. Calliante</hi> ſaid hee was a <hi>Man,</hi> and beeing asked if it was not <hi>hee, who not long before, beeing in a</hi> Woman's <hi>habit, went under the Name of</hi> Almeria, he anſwered, <hi>Yes:</hi> This raiſed a generall laughter, as if hee had been an <hi>Hermaphrodite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serife</hi> denyed that <hi>Shee</hi> was <hi>Iphis,</hi> proteſting <hi>that</hi> ſhee was a <hi>Woman;</hi> and her depoſition was the leſs believed, becauſe true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piſides</hi> fearing to diſpleaſe <hi>Iphis,</hi> ſaid, <hi>that hee knew not what that</hi> Lady <hi>was, but hee was</hi> Iphis <hi>humble ſervant, and that</hi> Iphis <hi>was a</hi> Man <hi>of ſuch quality, that they ſhould finde hee had power to Judge his</hi> Judges, <hi>and puniſh that</hi> Country <hi>with</hi> Fire <hi>and</hi> Sword, <hi>if they did</hi> Him <hi>the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;</hi> Beeing demanded what the Quality of that <hi>Iphis</hi> was, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>that hee had Age and Wiſdom enough to ſatisfie them himſelf:</hi> Beeing urged to declare his own Condition, hee told them, <hi>hee was a</hi> Gentleman <hi>of the retinue of that ſame</hi> Iphis: Beeing asked why hee had ſo diſguiſed himſelf, <hi>to paſs my time</hi> (anſwered hee) <hi>and pleaſe</hi> him <hi>that commanded mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argal,</hi> in ſtead of anſwering to their <hi>interrogatories,</hi> laughed at his <hi>Examiners;</hi> to their <hi>threatnings</hi> hee returned <hi>Bravadoes</hi> (which had ſuited better with a Man in Liberty, than a Priſoner) and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his Captivity, ſpeaking like a Reſolute Captain, at the head of a gallant Party of Horſe, that had command to cut thoſe Rogues in pieces, hee had nothing but <hi>Fire, Sword, Slaughter</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> in his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomeran,</hi> more ſerious and temperate, anſwered with much more Modeſty and Reſervedneſs, and judging <hi>that</hi> a brave <hi>Spirit</hi> ought to ſay nothing but the <hi>truth,</hi> hee told them really his Opinion, and what hee eſteemed ought to bee ſaid for the Honour of <hi>Serife,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Gentlemen, it is not good handling a burning Coal, nor an Iron red hot without Tongs, you have</hi> Him <hi>in your Hands, in whoſe</hi> you <hi>are, and who hath the power to Exerciſe an horrible Revenge upon you, if you do him the least Diſpleaſure. I advertiſe you that this</hi> Lady <hi>whom you have impriſoned, and who hath given herſelf the Name of</hi> Serife, <hi>is your</hi> Palatine IPHIGENES, <hi>whom the love of</hi> Almeria <hi>hath thus transformed; and</hi> Almeria <hi>is no other than</hi> Calliante, <hi>who hath made thoſe People (that have cauſed us to be put here) believe hee was her</hi> Brother, <hi>but I can aſſure you hee is the ſame</hi> Almeria, <hi>who is likewiſe a</hi> Gentleman <hi>of quality. I confeſs this</hi> Changing <hi>of</hi> cloathes <hi>is againſt the</hi> Lawes; <hi>but theſe</hi> Lawes <hi>are but like</hi> Spider's <hi>Webs, which catch onely the

               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that have gotten the repute of <hi>Liars,</hi> are ſo unhappy as not to be believed when they ſpeak <hi>Truth; Pomeran</hi> ſeeming to ſpeak more <hi>wiſely</hi> than the reſt, was held to bee the greateſt <hi>Fool,</hi> and his Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were as little regarded, as thoſe of <hi>Caſſandra</hi> by the Inhabitants of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> beeing laſt of all to Anſwer, deſired to ſpeak in private with him that was to examine him, and (knowing that nothing was impoſſible nor impenetrable by the Power of <hi>God</hi>) dazled his Eyes with ſome pieces in hand, and the promiſe of a greater ſumme in caſe hee qualified that buſineſs, and reſtored to liberty ſo many <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> who were not accuſed for any crime, and at the worſt could be convinced onely of a piece of Youthfull <hi>folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Judge,</hi> who went in as fierce as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> came out again after this Conference as gentle as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> having promiſed <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> to let them all out by the <hi>golden</hi> Gate; but for the more clear Eſcape it would bee requiſite that they ſhould make themſelves a Bridge of <hi>Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, for Form's ſake hee examined <hi>Him</hi> again and the <hi>reſt</hi> in the Preſence of their <hi>Accuſers</hi> and <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> whoſe <hi>Hearts</hi> were ready to flie out of their <hi>Mouths</hi> for joy, to ſee themſelves triumphant over thoſe that would have affronted them. All their anſwers were ſo ambiguous, and their ambiguity ſo different, that it was no leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to expound them than thoſe ancient <hi>Oracles,</hi> which had ſeverall Faces and divers Senſes. In ſumme, there was nothing ſaid, whereon they could build any conjecture.</p>
               <p>At length, theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> asked leave to write to <hi>Serife,</hi> that by <hi>her</hi> authority <hi>ſhee</hi> might deliver <hi>them</hi> out of trouble: This was granted, upon condition that the <hi>Judge</hi> firſt ſaw their Letters, who found
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51476:108"/> ſport enough in the diverſity of their <hi>ſtyles.</hi> For one called her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> another <hi>Sir,</hi> the third <hi>My Lord,</hi> which made the doubt grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſo puzled thoſe <hi>thick-ſcull'd</hi> fellowes, that they could not deviſe what to cenſure. Thoſe <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> like <hi>Surgeons</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians</hi> (whoſe profit is by tedious ſickneſſes and wounds that are a long time healing) thought by protracting this buſineſs to make themſelves all rich. But whileſt our <hi>Priſoners</hi> are learning <hi>Patience</hi> in it's true <hi>ſchool,</hi> let us ſee what is acted more ſeriouſly upon the <hi>Theater</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> and <hi>how</hi> theſe paſſages were but a ſhadow, and a weak repreſentation of that which paſſed, contrary to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> knowledge, in places, where hee had <hi>intereſt,</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> to preſerve more tenderly his Reputation.</p>
               <p>It is a frequent obſervation of <hi>Hiſtoriographers,</hi> that before Wars (which are God's Scourges) begin in any Country, there are ſeen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſigns which ſerve for preſages of Civill Diſſentions, as terrible <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, Apparitions,</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> ſeeming to joyn Battle in the Air. Theſe <hi>Rurall</hi> recreations which wee have here repreſented, were in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the fore-runners of the troubles, and divers <hi>For tunes</hi> which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> as will appear in the ſequele of this <hi>Narration.</hi> The Actions of great Perſons, and of thoſe who are placed like Luminaries in the Orbes of eminent Charges, can bee no more kept hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den than the Light; which (in how cloſe a place ſoe're it bee) diſcover's it ſelf by ſending it's Rayes, and Splendor through ſome little hole or cranny. The <hi>Palatine's</hi> diſguiſement could not bee long diſguiſed at <hi>Plocens;</hi> What hee thought to do in <hi>private,</hi> was ſaid <hi>openly;</hi> what hee practiſed in the ſecret retreats of the <hi>Forest,</hi> was the common table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk in the <hi>City,</hi> either by the indiſcretion of his own Hunts-men, or the Relation of ſome of <hi>Celian's</hi> Neighbours. In ſumme, hee could not keek his <hi>Fire</hi> ſo cloſe but that it was diſcovered by it's <hi>ſmoak.</hi> An ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious report is like a ſpot of <hi>Oyl,</hi> which increaſeth as inceſſantly as inſenſibly. The <hi>Court</hi> was already filled with theſe <hi>Rurall</hi> Affections of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and (as the leaſt failings of <hi>Favorites</hi> are ſifted and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by their enviers) <hi>Heaven</hi> know's with what <hi>Gloſſes</hi> they adorned this ſimple <hi>Text.</hi> Every one cenſured him according to their humours; Some pittied, others fed their Envy with his folly: Onely the <hi>King</hi> could not believe ſo extreme an over-ſight of him, whom hee had alwayes found ſo extraordinary diſcreet beyond what could bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from his years. His <hi>Calumniators</hi> without conſidering that this <hi>Report</hi> might bee falſe, publiſhed it for an evident truth with all the amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51476:108"/> their <hi>Malice</hi> could ſuggeſt. But among ſo many <hi>Objects</hi> that were taken with the preſence of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> none beeing inamored comparably to the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> you may imgaine with what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her Ears received this news, what a multitude of confuſed thoughts immediately aſſembled in her braine. Shee grew exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impatient concerning her expeditions from <hi>Rome,</hi> (which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of their <hi>Seal,</hi> go but with <hi>Leaden</hi> Feet;) this occurrence redoubled her longing, and ſet a ſpur in her <hi>Heart,</hi> which pricked her to know a truth no leſs than ſhee feared to finde it. Shee laboured all ſhee could at <hi>Court</hi> to ſmother this report; but what could her <hi>Tongue</hi> do alone againſt ſo many <hi>Mouths</hi> opened to <hi>Detraction?</hi> As for <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> the intereſt hee had in his <hi>Son's</hi> reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on caſt him into a rage not eaſily to bee expreſſed, hearing in what manner it was wounded; And hee reſolved to applie ſuch remedies as his <hi>Prudence</hi> ſhould inform him to be moſt convenient. For, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake as many quarrells as there were ſcandalls, would have been a labour more difficult than that of <hi>Hercules</hi> againſt the <hi>Hydra.</hi> But as Miſchiefs ſeldome come alone, another trouble fell upon the neck of this, which put him into no leſs diſtemper than the former.</p>
               <p>If the news of this <hi>Paſtorall Love</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> diſturbed the <hi>Minde</hi> of the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> aſſoon as nimble <hi>Fame</hi> had diſperſed it in <hi>Podolia,</hi> and conveyed it to <hi>Modeſtina's</hi> Ears, ſhee was poſſeſſed with ſo inraged a <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> that without the <hi>Hope</hi> ſhee had of eſcaping by ſome induſtry out of <hi>Priſon,</hi> to go ſeek her Husband, and tear him out of thoſe Arms unworthy to imbrace him, Shee had doubtleſs by ſome deſperate wound forthwith ſet a period to both <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Pain.</hi> Shee had no ſooner framed the Deſign of going to him, at what rate and in what manner ſoever it was, but ſhee began to think of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by corrupting ſome of her Keepers. It was in vain, ſhee knew, to offer to tempt her Governeſs <hi>Perpetua</hi> (ſhee beeing too rigorous an obſerver of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> his <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> commands:) Therefore ſhee caſt her Eyes upon a young Youth (Son to ſome Officer of the <hi>Caſtle</hi>) who beeing about her growth, and having yet not the leaſt ſign of any Beard in his Face, might bee taken for a <hi>Woman,</hi> if his habit had been ſuitable.</p>
               <p>After ſhee had gained this young Keeper, by her Preſents and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that the <hi>Palatine,</hi> her <hi>Husband</hi> ſhould advance his <hi>Fortunes, Shee</hi> beeing covered with a Suite of <hi>His,</hi> hee found the means by favour of the dusky Evening to convey her ſafely out of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and having
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51476:109"/> provided, a quarter of a League off, a good Horſe for her, and another for himſelf, hee brought her at length to <hi>Plocens,</hi> by the croſſeſt and leaſt-beaten wayes hee could pick out. If the exceſs of her <hi>Affection,</hi> had not been accompained with an extream <hi>Juſtice,</hi> I ſhould bee loth to excuſe her <hi>Action,</hi> or make her appear in ſuch manner as might give Birth to any ſcandalous cenſure. But who can with reaſon blame a <hi>Wife</hi> that followe's her <hi>Husband,</hi> to take him out of the Arms of an <hi>Adultereſs?</hi> unleſs hee will likewiſe accuſe <hi>Marriage</hi> it ſelf, whoſe Law is ſuch, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Husband</hi> hath not the power of his <hi>Body,</hi> but the <hi>Wife;</hi> as reciprocally the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Wife</hi> is not her's, but her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's,</hi> on whom ſhee abſolutely depend's.</p>
               <p>Beeing arrived at <hi>Plocens,</hi> ſhee fitted herſelf with handſomer and richer Cloathes, than thoſe which ſhee brought out of her Houſe of bondage: And, leſt <hi>Menochius</hi> (ſo was her <hi>Conductor</hi> named) ſhould be known by any of <hi>Iphigenes's</hi> followers, that might have ſeen him in <hi>Podolia,</hi> ſhee bought him a <hi>Woman's</hi> habit, and charged him to ſtay in the <hi>Inn,</hi> whileſt ſhee went like the <hi>Man</hi> about the <hi>City,</hi> to inquire what news was there of her <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> which ſhee found but too conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the report ſhee had heard in her Priſon. But ſhee, having much reſemblance of her Brother <hi>Liante's</hi> favour, was preſently taken for him by ſome of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> followers, who took particular notice of her Lodging, thinking to oblige their <hi>Master</hi> at his return, by telling him that his <hi>Brother-in-law</hi> was there. The poor <hi>Lady</hi> was much in pain to know in what <hi>Foreſt</hi> her <hi>Husband</hi> was with his <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> yet ſhee durſt not bee too inquiſitive, for fear of diſcovering herſelf; Beſides, that buſineſs was ſo cloſely carried, that although this <hi>Endymion</hi> was known to bee in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> with his <hi>Diana,</hi> yet very few could give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions where to finde him; So that to ingage herſelf in the <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> of thoſe intricate Woods, (wherewith that <hi>Province</hi> was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly covered) had been the way to <hi>loſe</hi> herſelf rather than finde what ſhee <hi>ſought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt ſhee was in this perplexity, <hi>Mieſlas</hi> (having received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations out of <hi>Podolia</hi> of her eſcape) arrived at <hi>Plocens,</hi> imagining that ſhee would have poſted thither to her <hi>Husband,</hi> as a <hi>Straw</hi> flie's to <hi>Amber.</hi> This tydings troubled <hi>Reſpicia</hi> no leſs than <hi>Mieſlas;</hi> For, ſhee apprehended, like <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>conſummation</hi> of that <hi>Marriage,</hi> which was the <hi>Death</hi> of all her <hi>Hopes.</hi> The <hi>Amoretta's</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with that <hi>Shepherdeſs</hi> gave no ſmall allarm to her <hi>Heart,</hi> yet eſteeming them onely a liberty of <hi>Youth,</hi> and rather to divert his <hi>Melancholly</hi> than out
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51476:109"/> of any deſire to caſt himſelf away upon a creature ſo much below his Quality, the tumults of her <hi>Mind</hi> were the ſooner pacified; But upon notice of <hi>Modeſtina's</hi> flight, <hi>Paſſion</hi> pleading her intereſt, ſhee depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Court,</hi> within ſhort time after <hi>Mieſlas;</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſpeed hee could make, ſhee arrived in a manner aſſoon as he at <hi>Plocens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> was no ſooner alighted at his <hi>Son's</hi> Palace, but inquiring for him hee learn't that hee had been neer a Moneth loſt in the <hi>Foreſt;</hi> but no body could tell him any other particulars, than <hi>that</hi> having found a <hi>Shepherdeſs</hi> which pleaſed his Fancy, hee had diſmiſſed all his train, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving onely two or three of his familiareſt Friends to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in his <hi>Courtſhip.</hi> To finde out where hee was thus fettered with the <hi>Chains</hi> of his own <hi>Will,</hi> was a difficult matter; For, hee had ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhape and places ſo often, <hi>that</hi> it had been as hard to follow his ſteps, as the <hi>ſtrain</hi> of a <hi>Stag</hi> that doubles and uſes all his wiles to deceive the purſuing <hi>Hounds.</hi> But in ſtead of <hi>ſeeking</hi> him, whom hee had no hope to <hi>finde,</hi> hee was informed of one, whom hee did not <hi>ſeek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, one of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> domeſticks (thinking nothing) ſaid to him, <hi>My Lord, though the</hi> Palatine <hi>bee not here, his</hi> Brother-in-law <hi>is in this</hi> City, <hi>expecting (I believe) my</hi> Lord's <hi>return. What?</hi> Liante? (<hi>replied</hi> Mieſlas <hi>amazed) where is hee?</hi> The ſimple fellow told him his Lodging, and offer'd to goe call him to him, if hee pleaſed to command him: <hi>But lest hee ſhould not obey, take two or three of my ſervants with you,</hi> (ſaid Mieſlas) <hi>that if hee be unwilling you may bring him perforce.</hi> You may imagine with what aſtoniſhment was poor <hi>Modeſtina</hi> ſeized, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into her Chamber (when ſhee leaſt ſuſpected them) four men armed with Sword and Piſtoll, which comanded her to goe before the Lord <hi>Mieſlas Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia. Who, I?</hi> (ſaid ſhee) <hi>what's his will with mee?</hi> My Lord <hi>Liante,</hi> replied the chief of them, <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his arrivall, that you expected here his</hi> Son's <hi>return, hee judged it more fit for you to ſtay in his</hi> Houſe (<hi>which, you know, is at your command) than to lodge in an</hi> Inn, <hi>and I am confident that</hi> Iphigenes <hi>at his coming will acknowledge it. Gentlemen,</hi> anſwered the imaginary <hi>Liante, if that bee all, I had rather enjoy my</hi> Liberty <hi>in an</hi> Inn, <hi>than bee a</hi> Priſoner <hi>in his</hi> Houſe, <hi>as hee hath kept mee already too long; I pray thank him for his courteous proffer, and tell him, that I left not his</hi> Houſe <hi>with an intent to return any more with my good will; Hee hath put us ſo in his</hi> Houſe, <hi>that hee hath drawn our</hi> Houſe <hi>into his, and not content to deprive us of our</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, <hi>hee will yet triumph over our</hi> Liberty, <hi>which is the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51476:110"/> on Earth. Sir</hi> (ſaid hee, to whom <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had given the command) <hi>do not take it ſo, wee have order to carry you to him alive or dead, be you willing or unwilling, and you had better go quietly with us than oblige us to bind you, and drag you along the ſtreets, for wee are reſolved to execute faithfully what hee hath injoyned us. Is it thus,</hi> anſwered the diſguiſed Liante, that <hi>you treat perſons of my</hi> Quality? <hi>Lett's goe then, ſince I muſt follow the</hi> Deſtinies, <hi>and ſubmit to the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Neceſſity; <hi>I hope his</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty <hi>beeing informed of this</hi> Violence <hi>will do mee</hi> Juſtice, <hi>and deliver mee speedily out of the</hi> Hands <hi>of his</hi> Tyranny. So they went to the Palace, where <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had given order to impriſon <hi>Liante</hi> in a cloſe Chamber, with a ſtrong Guard, untill hee ſhould bee further reſolved what to do with him. Hee would not ſuffer him to come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, leſt his tender Age, and ſupplications ſhould kindle any ſpark of pitty in his inhumane breſt.</p>
               <p>Next Morning, leſt the intreaties or authority of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in his own <hi>Palatinate,</hi> ſhould reſtore him to <hi>Liberty,</hi> his <hi>Cruelty</hi> ſuggeſted to his <hi>Fancy</hi> the moſt <hi>barbarous</hi> reſolution that e're was harboured in the heart of <hi>Man,</hi> to bee quit of that innocent Creature (whoſe Gardian hee was, and whom hee ought to have cheriſhed as the apple of his Eye.) But to what will that execrable hunger of <hi>Riches,</hi> and the ſtings of <hi>Ambition</hi> not tranſport men's thoughts? In Hiſtories wee finde ſome examples of <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers,</hi> who renouncing all intereſt of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> have either murthered or made blinde their own children for the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of ruling. What doth this ſavage <hi>Sarmatian</hi> to extinguiſh abſolutely in the race of his Predeceſſor in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Podoha,</hi> the hope of <hi>Progeny,</hi> and by that means make all the inheritance ſure to his own Family? Hee gave order to deliver the <hi>Priſoner</hi> into the hands of certain bloudy Villains (fully diſpoſed to the execution of his <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſms</hi>) commanding them to carry him back to his Priſon in <hi>Podolia,</hi> and make him an Eunuch by the way, or kill him in caſe hee would not ſuffer that affront, which is the moſt ſenſible that any mortall could receive.</p>
               <p>Theſe rugged Executioners led away the ſuppoſed <hi>Liante,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with <hi>Death,</hi> to make him condeſcend to ſuffer that indignity by the deſire of <hi>Life:</hi> But before his departure they bade him examine his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and prepare himſelf for a journy, longer than hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, not onely from <hi>Plocens</hi> into <hi>Podolia,</hi> but out of this <hi>World</hi> into the next.</p>
               <p>Some of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> followers having intelligence of this <hi>Tyranny,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51476:110"/> and abhorring it, were inraged they could not prevent it, and <hi>hee</hi> that had been the imprudent Inſtrument of the poor <hi>Gentleman's</hi> beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, was ready to bee his own Executioner, fearing the juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of his <hi>Maſter,</hi> when hee ſhould come to the knowledge of ſo unjuſt and horrid a Fact. Among the reſt, <hi>Arcade</hi> having notice thereof (thinking to oblige his <hi>Maſter</hi> by advertiſing him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſave the miſerable <hi>Liante's</hi> Life) preſently took Horſe, and rode with all poſſible ſpeed unto that part of the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> where few Dayes before hee had met <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and ſerved him under the name of <hi>Serife,</hi> where not finding him, after much inquiry hee learn't the way to <hi>Celian's</hi> Village.</p>
               <p>The report of thoſe <hi>Stranger's</hi> impriſonment beeing diſperſed all over that part of the Country, at his arrivall in the Village, hee asked to ſpeak with the <hi>Lord Palatine,</hi> about ſome buſineſs of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. At the firſt the People laughed at him, thinking <hi>that</hi> his coming had been ſome new Impoſture, and illuſion to dazle the Eyes of their <hi>Judges,</hi> and hinder them from doing <hi>Juſtice.</hi> At length hee ſpake ſo much <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that they took his <hi>Folly</hi> for <hi>Diſcretion;</hi> and to act with more aſſurance, they apprehended him and put him into another room of the Priſon, to hear more at leaſure his depoſitions. Wherein hee declared, <hi>that hee demanded a</hi> Nobleman, <hi>habited like a</hi> Gentlewoman, <hi>who made herſelf bee called</hi> Serife <hi>for private reaſons which hee knew not;</hi> That <hi>this</hi> Nobleman <hi>was his</hi> Maſter, <hi>and</hi> that <hi>this</hi> Maſter <hi>was</hi> Palatine <hi>of</hi> Plocens, <hi>named</hi> Iphigenes: That <hi>there was hapned ſince his</hi> abſence <hi>an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence which required his</hi> preſence, <hi>So neceſſarily,</hi> that <hi>it concerned no leſs than the Life of one of thoſe perſons, whom hee eſteemed the deareſt in the</hi> World.</p>
               <p>This relation waken'd the <hi>Judge's</hi> attention; For, <hi>Arcade</hi> ſpake ſo ſeriouſly, <hi>that</hi> they could not think hee came to deceive them. Yet before they told him that <hi>Serife</hi> was in Priſon, they led him to <hi>Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaüs</hi> Chamber, who asked him at the firſt ſight, <hi>What?</hi> Arcade <hi>is my</hi> Lord <hi>out of</hi> Priſon? <hi>doth hee take pleaſure to make us lie languiſhing here? For my part I comprehend not his meaning, but I finde no</hi> Felicity <hi>in ſuch</hi> Paſtimes, <hi>I prethee bid him leave off theſe</hi> Fopperies <hi>ſpeedily, at leaſt if hee will oblige mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How</hi> (anſwered <hi>Arcade) ſhould I tell him that? I know not where hee is; theſe People have made mee a</hi> Priſoner, <hi>I know not whether it bee by his</hi> Order <hi>or by</hi> Inchantment, <hi>but I am ſure there is a buſineſs in hand at</hi> Plocens (<hi>for which I am come hither) that require's none of theſe delayes,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51476:111"/> unleſs hee will ſuffer his</hi> Brother-in Law <hi>to loſe his Life. What?</hi> replied <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> much troubled, <hi>have they ſent</hi> Calliante <hi>to</hi> Plocens? <hi>what talk you of</hi> Calliante? (<hi>ſaid</hi> Arcade) <hi>I know no ſuch</hi> Man, <hi>but I ſay</hi> Liante <hi>my</hi> Maſter's <hi>Wive's</hi> Brother. <hi>That is the ſame I mean,</hi> anſwered Boleſlaus, <hi>and whom they have put in Priſon here with us. I know not,</hi> ſaid Arcade, <hi>wherefore you are</hi> Priſoners, <hi>unleſs it bee to pleaſe the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine's <hi>Fancy,</hi> but <hi>I cannot conceive what pleaſure there is in keeping you penn'd up thus: Is it not that hee may have more liberty to dally in the Woods with his</hi> Diana? <hi>Malediction light upon her, ſhee is cauſe that my</hi> Maſter <hi>is diſhonoured, and his reputation lost at</hi> Court, <hi>and all over</hi> Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. <hi>There's no other diſcourſe at</hi> Plocens, <hi>but of his</hi> Loves; <hi>and no body knowing the certainty, Every one speak's according to his own Fancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee is ſo far</hi> (ſaid Boleſlaus) <hi>from giving any ſuch command, that I tell thee, both</hi> Hee <hi>and</hi> Liante, <hi>with</hi> Pomeran, Piſides, Argal <hi>and</hi> my ſelf <hi>are all Priſoners here in ſeverall Chambers; whether the</hi> Palatine <hi>take pleaſure in it, or commanded it ſo, I cannot ſay, But wee have been now five or ſix Dayes in this trouble, neither can wee yet tell what theſe</hi> People <hi>intend to do with us. And I know leſs,</hi> Anſwered Arcade, <hi>how they mean to deal with mee, whom they have likewiſe apprehended for no other</hi> crime, <hi>that I know, than for demanding to speak with my</hi> Maſter. <hi>But in earneſt,</hi> Boleſlaus, <hi>are you a</hi> Priſoner, <hi>or is this ſtill to continue the ſtratagem you know of, and for which I was ſent away, becauſe I could not diſſemble and act my part ſo gravely as I ſhould?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I proteſt ſeriouſly,</hi> ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>there is no jeaſt in what I tell thee, and I have almoſt loſt my</hi> Reaſon <hi>and</hi> Temper <hi>in theſe</hi> fopperies. <hi>The</hi> Palatine <hi>hath brought us into theſe broils, but I do not ſee how hee will bee able to enlarge us again ſodainly, hee beeing in reſtraint as well as wee. How? a Priſoner,</hi> ſaid Arcade, <hi>did the</hi> King <hi>command him to bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? No, not the</hi> King ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>but theſe</hi> Peaſants, <hi>under the name of</hi> Serife, <hi>and with him (I tell thee) they have impriſoned all us that attended Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What?</hi> anſwered Arcade, <hi>is hee then yet in the</hi> Ladie's <hi>habit hee had when I left him, and his</hi> Lady (<hi>by conſequence) in</hi> Man's, <hi>and each in a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> Priſon? <hi>But would hee bee committed to</hi> Priſon, <hi>without diſcloſing his</hi> Quality? <hi>Nay more,</hi> ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>now that hee is in Priſon hee denieth</hi> himſelf <hi>to be what hee is, and ſaye's hee is what hee is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the ſtrangeſt fancy,</hi> anſwered Arcade, <hi>that ever I heard of, and which will produce new Diſcourſes, that will not redound to his</hi> Honour.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51476:111"/> 
                  <hi>However I muſt ſpeak with</hi> him, <hi>to tell him that hee muſt ſpeedily take ſome order to ſuccour his</hi> Brother-in-law, <hi>whom</hi> Mieſlas (<hi>who is now at</hi> Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens) <hi>hath delivered into the hands of certain fellowes, that will take away his</hi> Life <hi>or (at leaſt) his</hi> Honour, <hi>if they bee not prevented by ſome ſodain remedy. Hitherto,</hi> ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>thou haſt ſpoken like a diſcreet</hi> Man, <hi>but now I perceive thou raveſt; For, I know where</hi> Liante <hi>is and am ſure that hee cannot bee in</hi> Mieſlas <hi>hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their reaſoning might have continued long enough, e're they could have penetrated each other's meaning, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> not daring to ſpeak all hee knew, for fear of diſpleaſing <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and never beeing able to imagine the adventures of <hi>Modeſtina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of the Village, who heard all this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> knew not what elſe to think, than <hi>that</hi> of all the Fools that they had ſeen in their Lives, they never ſaw any ſo ſenſ-leſs. After this they led him to <hi>Pomeran, Piſides</hi> and <hi>Argal,</hi> whoſe diſcourſe was yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant; For, they knowing not <hi>Liante,</hi> ſpake altogether of an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria</hi> and a <hi>Calliante,</hi> names which <hi>Arcade</hi> never had heard: Inſomuch that the <hi>Judges</hi> could pick nothing out of their various Speeches, than cauſe of laughter.</p>
               <p>But when hee was brought into <hi>Calliante's</hi> Preſence, hee began to bleſs himſelf, his <hi>Heart</hi> panting as if hee had ſeen a <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> For, hee could not perſwade himſelf that without <hi>Negromancy</hi> hee could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him there, having ſeen him (as hee thought) at <hi>Plocens.</hi> At length, <hi>My Lord Liante,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>is it you whom I ſee, or hath ſome</hi> Spirit <hi>borrowed</hi> your <hi>ſhape? certainly you cannot bee in two places at once, and I am as ſure that I ſaw you at</hi> Plocens <hi>within theſe two dayes, as that your likeneſs now appear's before my Eyes; Either that which I ſaw at</hi> Plocens <hi>muſt bee an</hi> illuſion, <hi>or this which here troubleth my</hi> ſight. <hi>Yet me-think's it is your</hi> voyce, <hi>which I hear,</hi> ſaid hee (<hi>Liante</hi> having anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) <hi>But in regard</hi> Magicians <hi>by their</hi> Diabolicall <hi>Art, can counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit that as well as</hi> Faces, <hi>give mee leave to touch you,</hi> that <hi>I may know it is your</hi> Body. Which <hi>Liante</hi> having permitted; <hi>This is Fleſh and Bones,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>this is no</hi> Spirit <hi>certainly; I will rather believe that the other which I did onely ſee, and that at ſome diſtance too, was but a</hi> Viſion, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more than barbarous</hi> cruelty <hi>of</hi> Mieſlas <hi>will bee deceived, and I am glad for your ſake, that you are out of his</hi> power; <hi>for, if you were in the place of that</hi> Ghoſt <hi>of your's, which hee hath put into the hands of ſome no leſs</hi> inhumane <hi>than</hi> himſelf, <hi>I ſhould eſteem you the moſt unfortunate</hi> Gentleman <hi>upon</hi> Earth.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:51476:112"/>
               <p>Theſe words having bred in <hi>Liante's</hi> Spirit a curioſity to know what cruelty <hi>Mieſlas</hi> intended to his Perſon: <hi>Arcade</hi> told him what had paſſed at <hi>Plocens,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> it was the main cauſe of his coming into that Deſart, to acquaint <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with that deſign of <hi>Mieſlas.</hi> You may imagine what an allarme this made in <hi>Liante's</hi> Heart; with what impatience hee was preſently ſeized to ſee himſelf at Liberty, <hi>that</hi> hee might flie before that ſtorm, and avoid the clutches of that rigorous <hi>Sarmatian.</hi> Fear, which made him tremble at every ſhadow, bred a ſuſpition in his thoughts, that all this Paſtorall <hi>Comedy</hi> had been invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> onely to impe the wings of Time, and amuſe him untill <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had apprehended him, and ſent him back to his priſon; there to force him to ſuffer the affront whereof <hi>Arcade</hi> had given him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Theſe imaginations put him beyond all temper; and, ready to run into deſpair, hee fulminated terrible threats againſt thoſe Clowns, if they releaſed him not ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>Theſe apprehenſions ſo violent, and ſoviſible, gave birth to diverſe ſiniſter Opinions in the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Country-men</hi> there preſent, making them ſuſpect him for ſome notorious <hi>Criminall,</hi> or ſome dangerous <hi>Perſon;</hi> in regard <hi>Arcade</hi> talked of murthering or reducing him to an incapacity of aſpiring to <hi>Marriage:</hi> yet the ſtrong impreſſion they had <hi>Calliante</hi> was <hi>Almeria,</hi> and really a <hi>Woman,</hi> made them revoke all this ſtory into doubt, as a fiction invented to delude their Senſes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that in ſtead of giving <hi>Liante</hi> any hope of a ſodain inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they made him cloſer Priſoner, having received no other conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by <hi>Arcade's</hi> viſit, than the aſſurance of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> beeing at <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> and of the horrible deſire hee had to commit in his perſon the Murther of his <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence <hi>Arcade</hi> was conducted to <hi>Serife's</hi> Lodging, who after a long <hi>Paradoxicall</hi> Conference (beeing certainly informed of her <hi>Father's</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall in that <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by whom ſhee had no will to bee ſeen in that equipage, and a <hi>Priſoner</hi> to thoſe baſe People, whom (according to the authority of <hi>Palatines</hi> in <hi>Polonia</hi>) with the leaſt word ſhee could have ſent to the Gallowes) raiſing the tone of her voyce in a more grave and <hi>Majeſtick</hi> manner, than became the quality of a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> ſhee thus ſpake to her <hi>Judges;</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>diſpatch quickly your</hi> formalities, <hi>and do mee</hi> Juſtice, <hi>I begin to bee weary of this</hi> Priſon: <hi>Whether I am</hi> Man <hi>or</hi> Woman, <hi>is nothing materiall to any of you.</hi> Beſides, <hi>I believe you can lay no</hi> Crime <hi>to my</hi> Charge, <hi>nor</hi> Calliante's, <hi>who for paſtime onely, not with any ill intent, conſpired with thoſe</hi> Swains (<hi>whom you have ſet at</hi>

Do not make mee intreat you twice to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge mee; For, if you compell mee to diſcover who I am, there is not hee among you, but will tremble at my very</hi> name, <hi>beeing able to render you of Judges</hi> Criminals, <hi>of Apprehenders</hi> Priſoners, <hi>and ſend you preſently, if I pleaſe, from the</hi> Gaole <hi>to</hi> Execution.</p>
               <p>Theſe words ſhee pronounced with ſo couragious and <hi>Maſculine</hi> an accent, that notwithſtanding her delicate Complexion and <hi>Feminine</hi> dreſs, they began to perſwade their fancies that ſhee was more than a <hi>Woman.</hi> But if <hi>Hercules</hi> could not reſiſt two, what ſhould ſhee have done againſt ſo many? It is the naturall diſpoſition of <hi>Clowns,</hi> and ſuch Mechanick <hi>Souls,</hi> as compoſe the Lees of the People, to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, and as inflexible as <hi>Lions</hi> or <hi>Tigres,</hi> when they have the power in their own hands; as they are like meer <hi>Cowes</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> when they are in ſubjection. They ſcoffed at <hi>Serife's</hi> words, and, according to the cuſtome of ſuch <hi>Brutes,</hi> they imparted their ſcorn to the <hi>Eccho's</hi> of that ſolitude by their lowd ſhouting.</p>
               <p>After which, one more impudent than the reſt, replied, <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Miſtreſs, (What ſhall I call you?) What or whoſoever you bee, wee ſhall teach you to ſpeak otherwiſe, and not to affront People in this manner. You muſt not think to rule us, but to bee ordered by us, who have power to keep you here untill your Proceſs bee ended, or diſcharge you at our pleaſure; wee will teach you to</hi> obey, <hi>not</hi> command, <hi>and if need bee, wee want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Bolts <hi>nor</hi> Manacles <hi>for your</hi> Feet <hi>and</hi> Hands, <hi>nor yet</hi> Gags <hi>for your</hi> Mouth, <hi>to the end you may know another time how to reſpect Officers of</hi> Juſtice. <hi>If there bee any</hi> Magicall <hi>operations in all this, the</hi> illuſions <hi>will ceaſe by the</hi> authority <hi>of the</hi> Judges, <hi>and wee ſhall ſo conjure thoſe</hi> Spirits, <hi>that in ſpight of their reſiſtance wee ſhall bring the</hi> truth <hi>to</hi> light, <hi>and make it appear to your</hi> confuſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe words having tranſported <hi>Serife</hi> into a more violent <hi>fury</hi> than ever <hi>Anger</hi> had kindled in her Breſt, ſhee was ready to declare her true Name and Quality; and <hi>Arcade</hi> likewiſe was much tempted to tell that ſawcy <hi>Clown,</hi> that hee ſhould deerly repent that Language; (yet hee forbore, for fear of diſobliging him, whom hee deſired to ſerve, and whoſe indignation hee dreaded no leſs than Thunder;) But without further delay they made him quit the room, and having ne're the more cleered their doubts by this confronting of the parties, they left <hi>Serife</hi> to entertain her cholerick thoughts, and re-incloſed <hi>Arcade</hi> betwixt foure walls, threatning to torture him if hee told them not the naked <hi>Truth.</hi>

               <p>The like Meſſage was ſent to the other <hi>Priſoners,</hi> and by the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe's</hi> means came to <hi>Serife's</hi> Ears, which increaſed her Rage to a reſolution of conſuming all that Country with Fire and Sword. But there was no remedy, ſhee muſt indure the bitterneſs of that Pill, not having then the Power to declare her Grievances to any but the Walls of her Priſon, as deaf, as her brutall <hi>Judges</hi> were inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the reſt of the Priſoners, allarmed with the barbarous inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Rusticks,</hi> conſume their <hi>Spirits</hi> in impatient ſumings, threatning, and meditating moſt remarkeable revenges: The ſubtle <hi>Boleſtaüs</hi> (who knew <hi>that</hi> Needles are not thredded by violent ſtroaks, and <hi>that</hi> Birds beeing fallen into the Fowler's gins intangle themſelves the worſe, the more they ſtruggle) having preferred a Petition to thoſe <hi>Country-Judges,</hi> full of Modeſt &amp; Submiſſive Tearms, beſides Promiſes of revealing great matters to them, they went to his Chamber, where ſpeaking in private to the ſame <hi>Officer,</hi> (whoſe hand hee had already oyled) and having diſpoſed his Ears to give a favourable audience by repleniſhing the hollow of his hooked hand with <hi>Crowns; Sir</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>much miſchief may ariſe by this buſineſs, if it bee diſcuſſed by</hi> rigor <hi>of</hi> Juſtice, <hi>in regard it concernes the</hi> Honour <hi>and</hi> Life <hi>of</hi> Perſons <hi>of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Quality, who may reſent it in an high nature; and nothing can fall to your ſhare by the way of</hi> Proceſs, <hi>but perchance ſome Forfeitures and Fees, to make you bee indulgent to thoſe that proſecute; Were it not better for you to oblige ſo many</hi> Perſons <hi>of</hi> Honour, <hi>who are now in your</hi> Power, <hi>and gain foure times as much?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwered Boleſlaus, <hi>I mean it ſo, and Ile aſſure that the</hi> ſumme <hi>you ſhall receive ſhall bee all in good</hi> pieces <hi>and down</hi> weight: <hi>But you know I cannot coin them here, either give mee leave to go fetch them, or procure mee a truſty</hi> Meſſenger, <hi>who ſhall receive them upon a</hi> Letter, <hi>which I hope you will permit mee to</hi> write. <hi>As for going out</hi> (replied the Judge) <hi>that is a thing I cannot condeſcend unto; For,</hi> Priſoners <hi>are like</hi> Birds <hi>which</hi> Sing <hi>no more when out of the</hi> Cage; <hi>and</hi> Nightingales <hi>which are obſerved never to warble, but in the</hi> Neſt, <hi>where they hatch their Eggs. But for writing I am well contented to permit; So that I ſee your</hi> Letter: <hi>For, I am no Man to indure any treacherous dealing. I deſire no better than that you ſhould</hi> read <hi>what I</hi> write (<hi>ſaid</hi> Boleſlaus) <hi>For, my intentions are no other than</hi> juſt <hi>and</hi> honeſt.</p>
               <p>Then, Paper beeing brought, hee traced ſome lines to a friend of his at <hi>Plocens,</hi> deſiring him to ſend upon ſight thereof the <hi>ſumme,</hi> which hee had indented to deliver that <hi>Juſtice</hi>-ſeller: And at the ſame time hee wrote another note to the Captain of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Guards, thus; <hi>It is of no leſs concernment than the</hi> Life <hi>and</hi> Honour <hi>of our</hi> Maſter (<hi>who beeing fallen into the hands of</hi> Theeves, <hi>is here impriſoned by them) that you ſhould come ſpeedily with your</hi> troop, <hi>whither this</hi> bearer <hi>ſhall direct you, make him give you right</hi> Inſtructions, <hi>by ſetting a</hi> Piſtoll <hi>to his</hi> Throat: <hi>But let not</hi> Mieſlas <hi>know any thing of your</hi> coming, <hi>nor of this</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p>The firſt note hee ſhewed the <hi>Judge,</hi> which was according to his own deſire, but hid the other in his ſleeve. The <hi>Judge</hi> having peruſed it, would have ſent it away preſently; <hi>But,</hi> ſaid <hi>Boleſlaüs, without my own Seal it will bee of no effect, therefore give mee leave to ſeal it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the</hi> ſumme, <hi>as you ſee, is of no ſmall importance.</hi> The <hi>Judge,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee ſpake as really as reaſonably, gave it him again to cloſe: But in ſeeming to ſeal it, hee ſlipt <hi>this</hi> into the place of the <hi>other</hi> in his ſleeve, (beeing both of one bigneſs and made up alike) and having written the ſuperſcription, and ſealed the later, hee delivered it to the <hi>Judge</hi> with ſome pieces of <hi>Gold</hi> to give the Meſſenger, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to let him goe on Hors-back, becauſe the buſineſs required haſte.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>golden</hi> conference the <hi>Judge</hi> grew more temperate, hee talked no more of torturing upon the Rack, but of releaſing the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,</hi> telling the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> that all thoſe paſſages were onely tricks of <hi>Youth,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> there was nothing to bee done in this caſe, but to plume them like <hi>Pigeons,</hi> and then let them flie again; and <hi>that</hi> it was enough
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51476:114"/> to let their Purſes blood, and make good cheer at their charge; by which means they would bee ſufficiently revenged of thoſe, that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no other evill than to laugh at their ſimplicity. But hee found more repugnance in thoſe ſavage <hi>Souls,</hi> than hee imagined; For, with one Voyce they all cryed out, <hi>Justice, Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This troubled the <hi>Judge</hi> not a little, knowing the brutality of the <hi>vulgar</hi> People of that Nation. But as hee that betraye's <hi>Juſtice,</hi> may as well betray the <hi>Criminals,</hi> It is no rare thing for <hi>Judges</hi> (whoſe Eyes have been dazled with the luſter of <hi>Gold</hi>) to condemne thoſe that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them, not to ſeem corruptible; and to hide their extortion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a double wickedneſs. This moved that abominable Miniſter of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> to make uſe of a moſt malicious Stratagem, to content that inraged <hi>Rabble</hi> by ſatisfying his own <hi>avarice.</hi> Hee reſolved to condemn to a privy ſearch thoſe perſons whoſe doubtfull faces did not by their Chins give evident teſtimony of beeing <hi>Men. Boleſlaüs,</hi> whom the <hi>Winter</hi> of <hi>Age</hi> had already covered with it's <hi>Snowy</hi> Livery, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from that harſh and ſhamefull ſentence; neither were <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Piſides</hi> or <hi>Argal</hi> concerned in that Decree, the downy ſhadow on their youthfull Checks declaring ſufficiently of what Sex they were. <hi>Serife</hi> and <hi>Calliante</hi> were the onely ſtumbling-blocks, whoſe changing of Habits multiplied the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> imaginations, and diſturbed their Reaſon; which (what er'e befell) hee thought ſhould ſerve to colour his unworthy ACT, adjudging them to very conſiderable amercements, in caſe of diſobedience.</p>
               <p>This Deſign hee communicated to the Proſecutors, who received it with a generall applauſe and acclamation, conceiving <hi>that</hi> they could no way have a more ſweet and full revenge of their cozening them, then by doing them this affront under the Cloake of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The Order was no ſooner drawn, but it was notified to <hi>Serife</hi> and <hi>Calliante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calliante,</hi> who eſteemed ſuch an indignity much leſs ſupportable than <hi>Death,</hi> threatned to tear in more pieces than the <hi>Bacchides</hi> did <hi>Pentheus,</hi> whoſoever ſhould approach him for that purpoſe: But they taking him to bee really a <hi>Woman,</hi> laughed at his weakneſs, telling him, <hi>that they had knockt down</hi> Bulls <hi>far ſtronger, and more fierce than hee.</hi> And the <hi>Phariſaicall Judge,</hi> to ſeem a modeſt and curteous Man, let him underſtand, <hi>that</hi> hee would do him the favour to give him the choice of beeing ſearcht by <hi>Men,</hi> if hee was a <hi>Man,</hi> or by <hi>Women,</hi> if a <hi>Woman;</hi> whereunto <hi>Calliante</hi> inraged, ſaid, <hi>I will have neither one
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51476:114"/> nor other, let mee alone as I am, for if any</hi> Women <hi>come to mee I ſhall make them aſhamed, and if you ſend any</hi> Men, <hi>I ſhall make them feele the ſtrength of my</hi> Arms.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Serife,</hi> ſhame and indignation ſo tranſported her, that to ſay which was greateſt, were no eaſie matter. All her Intreaties, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Proteſtations that ſhee was a <hi>Man</hi> and their <hi>Palatine,</hi> Son to <hi>Mieſlas, Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia,</hi> were to their rude Ears but as chaff before the Winde; and notwithſtanding her appealing, the <hi>Judge</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to execute his Order, without which they could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the <hi>Truth;</hi> at length, hee offered her the ſame civility as hee had to <hi>Calliante;</hi> to which ſhee returned a like anſwer, deſiring the <hi>Judge to cauſe</hi> Her <hi>to bee ſtrangled rather than condemn</hi> Her <hi>to an abuſe which</hi> Shee <hi>muſt reſent as long as</hi> Shee <hi>had breath, and whereby Her</hi> fury <hi>would bee incited to a</hi> Vengeance, <hi>that could not terminate him by the</hi> ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>and abſolute</hi> ruine <hi>of that whole County.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe high menaces that Clowniſh multitude anſwered with lowd laughing, preſſing her ſtill to chooſe, otherwiſe they would proceed to the Execution of the <hi>Judge's</hi> Ordinance: At length, a <hi>Ray</hi> of <hi>Prudence</hi> inlightning her in this extremity, made her Name <hi>Celian's</hi> two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their Siſter-in-law <hi>Belida,</hi> hoping to gain them by <hi>Gifts,</hi> or compell them by <hi>force</hi> to depoſe what ſhee liſted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> and the other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> knew nothing of theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; For, the <hi>Judge</hi> promiſed himſelf, that his Meſſenger would bee returned e're night with the <hi>ſumme,</hi> for which hee had indented with <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> and his Sentence beeing executed upon <hi>Serife</hi> and <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante,</hi> hee ſhould by that means pleaſe the <hi>Peaſants</hi> as well as his own covetous humour, and ſeem <hi>juſt,</hi> though his proceedings were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>This kindled ſo much <hi>choller</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> of the generous <hi>Amazon,</hi>

               <p>The Goddeſs <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> with her <hi>golden</hi> Tongue having inthroned herſelf by theſe words in <hi>Serife's</hi> Mouth, there was not one of the three <hi>Searches,</hi> but judged this good Office as feaſable as reaſonable. In this Reſolution they went forth, and having met the <hi>Judge,</hi> with the <hi>Swains,</hi> who expected their return, they remained ſome while ſpeechleſs, counterfeiting as much baſhfulneſs as if they had been ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſtrange buſineſs. Which gave ſome of the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> occaſion to cry out, <hi>Oh! oh! Did not wee gueſs right to ſay that</hi> Lady <hi>was a</hi> Man? Indeed <hi>Maſter Judge</hi> (anſwered Merinda) <hi>it was not ſo well done of you to ſcoff in this manner at our ſimplicity, and ſend ſuch, as wee are, to ſee</hi> Men <hi>that laugh at our</hi> folly. Then <hi>Belida,</hi> who beeing a Married Wife had ſomewhat more confidence, laughing full mouth, ſaid, <hi>By my</hi> Soul <hi>if that bee a</hi> Lady, <hi>my</hi> Husband <hi>may bee a</hi> Lady <hi>too; For, I am ſure they are both made alike;</hi> and turning towards <hi>Lupicin, See friend,</hi> (ſaid ſhee) <hi>upon what employments you ſend your</hi> Wife.</p>
               <p>This made an hooting ſuiteable to the condition of the perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom this <hi>Comedy</hi> was acted. That done, the <hi>Judge</hi> gave them Order forthwith to go to <hi>Calliante.</hi> Which they refuſed with much ſeeming unwillingneſs, and far-fetch'd excuſes, untill the <hi>Judge,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his gravity of <hi>Preſident,</hi> iterated his Command, telling them <hi>that they muſt obey the Ordinances of</hi> Juſtice, <hi>if not, hee knew how to compell them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon replied the crafty <hi>Belida,</hi> that <hi>ſhee was contented to obey, ſo that ſhee and her Sisters might first confer with him in private.</hi> That requeſt beeing thought too reaſonable to bee denied, ſhee told him punctually what had paſſed betwixt them and <hi>Serife,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> there was nothing more ſure than her beeing a <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Calliante</hi> a <hi>Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, they ſhewed him the <hi>preſents</hi> they had received of her, beſides the <hi>promiſe</hi> of three thouſand <hi>Crowns</hi> for themſelves, and twice as much for him, if hee would bee iudulgent in the Execution of that <hi>Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This made him as gentle as an <hi>Ermine's</hi> skin, and open both his <hi>Ears</hi> to their <hi>Propoſition;</hi> But to enhaunce his <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the higheſt rate, hee reſolved to gather with both Hands, as if hee had been in a <hi>Treaſury,</hi> in a <hi>Mine,</hi> or at an Harveſt of <hi>Gold:</hi> Therefore after a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51476:116"/> little pauſe, <hi>This is not enough</hi> (ſaid hee to them) <hi>Wee have now before our</hi> Eyes <hi>the faireſt opportunity of inriching our ſelves that can bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, wee muſt take it by the</hi> fore-lock, <hi>and beat this</hi> Iron <hi>whileſt it is</hi> hot, <hi>onely, (if you can) bee</hi> prudent <hi>and</hi> ſecret, <hi>otherwiſe in ſtead of</hi> gaining <hi>wee ſhall</hi> undoe <hi>our ſelves. You are now going to</hi> ſearch <hi>one that is really a</hi> Woman; <hi>if the other, who is a</hi> Man, <hi>beeing frighted with his</hi> Crime <hi>and</hi> Impriſonment, <hi>hath given and promiſed you ſo much, what may you not get of</hi> her, <hi>who will at what rate ſoever preſerve</hi> her honour, <hi>and free</hi> herſelf <hi>from the</hi> Infamy <hi>and</hi> Laughter <hi>of all theſe</hi> People? <hi>Go then, and manage your</hi> buſineſs <hi>ſo,</hi> that <hi>you may get a good</hi> fleece <hi>off</hi> her, <hi>and forget not</hi> mee; <hi>For, you know I ſit at the</hi> Helm, <hi>and</hi> that <hi>all muſt bee done by my</hi> Order, <hi>their</hi> Lives, Honours, Impriſoment, <hi>and</hi> Liberty <hi>beeing wholly in my</hi> Hands: <hi>Bee ſure you take not</hi> Promiſes <hi>for</hi> Payment, <hi>But put</hi> Eyes <hi>into your</hi> Hands <hi>to believe what they ſhall</hi> ſee <hi>and</hi> receive: <hi>For, if you do</hi> her <hi>the favour not to</hi> ſearch <hi>her according to the</hi> Order, <hi>it is but</hi> Reaſon <hi>that</hi> ſhee <hi>ſhould recompence</hi> your Courteſie <hi>with ſome remarkeable</hi> Gratification; <hi>Do not quit</hi> Her <hi>for leſs than what</hi> Iphis <hi>hath given and promiſed</hi> you, <hi>For, the</hi> Favour <hi>is greater to</hi> Her <hi>than</hi> Him.</p>
               <p>Beeing thus inſtructed, and determined to follow preciſely theſe Inſtructions, they went, like <hi>Commiſſaries</hi> deputed by the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to know of what <hi>Category Calliante</hi> was. And as a <hi>Ship</hi> ſaile's ſwifter when ſhee is in open <hi>Sea,</hi> and hath the <hi>Wind</hi> more full; So the greater <hi>hope</hi> theſe <hi>VVomen</hi> conceived, and the more their <hi>deſire</hi> of having was increaſed by the adviſe of that good <hi>Judge,</hi> the more eagerly and cheer-fully did they run to execute this ſecond <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> whereby they hoped to get more than they had done by the former; Neither was their expectation fruſtrated; For, they were no ſooner entred and had made their goodly Speech, but <hi>Calliante</hi> falling into a <hi>Lyon</hi>-like fury, in ſtead of ſpeaking, began to anſwer them with his Hands, making them feele the weight of a <hi>Man's</hi> Armes. The dore, which was lock'd again, that they might the more ſecretly, and without ſcandall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Office, gave him better opportunity of pummelling them; For, not beeing able to run away, they were inforced to indure that <hi>ſtorm</hi> of blowes without ſhelter. <hi>One</hi> had her <hi>Eyes</hi> beaten into her <hi>Head</hi> with his buffeting, another her <hi>Teeth</hi> ſtruck out, the <hi>third</hi> hee trampled under his <hi>Feet,</hi> which was not without their crying out <hi>Murther, help, help:</hi> But the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> who ſtayed within hearing, thought it had been <hi>Almeria,</hi> whom they three were forcing to a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51476:116"/> 
                  <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> which ſhee could not ſuffer without ſtriving and ſhame, &amp; in ſtead of ſuccouring them, they drowned their <hi>cries</hi> with <hi>laughing,</hi> till their <hi>Lungs</hi> were ready to ſplit, and calling out to them, <hi>You are three againſt one, you will overcome her at laſt; continue, do what the</hi> Juſtice <hi>hath commanded you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judge you what leiſure this gave <hi>Calliante</hi> to kick, and beat his <hi>Viſiters,</hi> as if they had been three <hi>barrs</hi> upon an <hi>Anvill,</hi> and his <hi>Fiſts</hi> the <hi>Hammers.</hi> At length having layd them all under his feet, ſo tired and ſore with blowes, that they could hardly breathe, one of them <hi>ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> another feined her ſelf <hi>dead;</hi> but <hi>Belida,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Calliante</hi> draw a Knife which hung at <hi>Merinda's</hi> Girdle, thought (as it was probable enough) that hee meant to cut their Throats; as a <hi>Torch</hi> that's going out caſteth the greater <hi>flame,</hi> ſo ſhee in that extremity, ſummoning all that little <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhee had left, cryed aloud, <hi>Lupicin, I am dead, Hee kill's mee, help, help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words made them conſider, that indeed they might have need of <hi>help, Deſpair</hi> having perchance tranſported <hi>Almeria</hi> to ſome <hi>action</hi> in her own <hi>defence</hi> beyond the ordinary ſtrength of a <hi>Woman;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ruſhed into the room, where they ſaw two lying like dead bodies on the ground, covered over with their own blood, and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liante</hi> dragging <hi>Belida</hi> about, with one hand up ready to ſheath the Knife in her boſome.</p>
               <p>It was then no time to <hi>conſult</hi> but to <hi>act;</hi> They preſently made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Calliante,</hi> who flinging that ſcurvy <hi>Woman</hi> from him, flew, like a <hi>Tigre</hi> that enter's into an <hi>Herd</hi> of <hi>Deer,</hi> among thoſe <hi>Ruſticks.</hi> Who ever ſaw a furious <hi>wild Bore</hi> foaming with rage, beeing incloſed in the <hi>Toyles</hi> between the <hi>Hunts men's</hi> Spears and the <hi>Hound's</hi> mouths, make an horrible ſlaughter, tearing out the bowells of this <hi>Dog</hi> here, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing another yonder, faſtning his <hi>Tusks</hi> in an <hi>Horſe's</hi> belly on another ſide, and trample upon the over-turned <hi>Rider;</hi> but at length beeing over-power'd with the multitude of <hi>Aſſailers,</hi> is inforced to ſubmit to the greater ſtrength; Hee may imagine the behaviour of <hi>Calliante</hi> in the midſt of that rude company; the firſt whereof that came neer him, received a great <hi>ſtab</hi> in his <hi>Arm,</hi> another a <hi>cut</hi> or'e the <hi>face,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers felt the ſmart of the ſame Weapon in other places: Hee flung himſelf here and there, and ſometimes by <hi>agility,</hi> ſometimes by main <hi>force,</hi> hee wreſted himſelf out of their hands, watching ſtill to get to the dore; But the throng of thoſe that preſſed to come in, rendered the paſſage impenetrable, which put him into ſuch an <hi>agony,</hi> as you may
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51476:117"/> imagine, ſeeing himſelf ready to bee murthered by the hands of thoſe irritated <hi>Swains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt having done all that a gallant <hi>courage</hi> ow'd to a juſt <hi>defence,</hi> ſo many People fell upon him at once, that they forced him to quit the <hi>Knife,</hi> and ſeeing him diſarmed and under their Feet, they began, by binding him Hand and Foot, the outrages which they were relol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make him ſuffer, deviſing ignominies and revenges inimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable againſt him. But the care they had of the wounded <hi>Women,</hi> and to recall their affrighted <hi>Spirits</hi> into their martyred <hi>Bodies,</hi> made them deferr for a while the puniſhing of <hi>Calliante,</hi> whom they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with no leſs than a ſhamefull Death.</p>
               <p>The Judge, who came in when all the <hi>blowes</hi> were paſt, and the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner</hi> faſt bound, inveighed highly againſt <hi>Calliante's</hi> Rebellion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning and reſiſting the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and precipitating his <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> hee ſaid, <hi>that nothing could make a ſufficient reparation but</hi> Death, <hi>and if that lewd</hi> Huſſif <hi>were not found to bee with</hi> Child, <hi>that</hi> ſhee <hi>ſhould bee executed the next morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the Conſolations of the poor <hi>Calliante,</hi> who beeing all bruiſed with <hi>blowes,</hi> beſides the <hi>pain</hi> hee received by the <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Chains</hi> wherewith hee was loden, ſaw himſelf upon the point of beeing <hi>Sacrifiſed</hi> to the <hi>vengeance</hi> of thoſe <hi>Salvages,</hi> whom it is not enough to call <hi>Sarmatians</hi> to expeſs their <hi>cruelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as that barbarous <hi>Rabble</hi> was going to make a ſhamefull <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> of the Body of <hi>Calliante,</hi> in the Opinion they had that hee was a <hi>Woman,</hi> intending the next day to make him indure a torment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their inhumane Diſpoſitions, the whole Village was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed on a ſodain with the arrivall of a great <hi>Troop</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> that came with great diligence: Before them rode a <hi>Man</hi> with his Arms pinion'd, and his <hi>Feet</hi> bound under the <hi>Horſe's</hi> Belly, as if hee had been ſome Notorious <hi>Thief</hi> whom the <hi>Provost Martiall</hi> had lately taken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Judge</hi> upon notice hereof, (thinking they had been ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of <hi>Juſtice</hi>) went forth to meet them, to deſire their aſſiſtance for the Execution of a <hi>Priſoner</hi> that would have broke the <hi>Gaole,</hi> and who had wounded divers perſons that withſtood him. <hi>Doubtleſs,</hi> ſaid the Captaine, <hi>this muſt bee the place: then, turning</hi> towards the fellow that was bound, hee continued, <hi>is not that Priſon here, whither wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to conduct us? Yes Sir,</hi> anſwered hee, <hi>and there is the</hi> Judge, <hi>who committed them, and ſent mee to you from one of the</hi> Priſoners <hi>to bring the</hi> ſumme <hi>of</hi> money <hi>conteined in the</hi> Letter.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:51476:117"/>
               <p>At theſe words the <hi>Judge</hi> knew his <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> and his <hi>Conſcience</hi> accuſing him, hee was ready to ſink with <hi>fear,</hi> when two or three of them ſetting their <hi>Piſtolls</hi> to his throat, ſaid, <hi>Deliver us</hi> My Lord <hi>quickly, or you are a Dead</hi> Man. <hi>What</hi> Lord? anſwered hee trembling: <hi>the</hi> Lord Palatine <hi>of</hi> Plocens <hi>whom you have impriſoned here, perchance not knowing him.</hi> Hereat a cold ſweat over-flowing the <hi>Judge's</hi> Face, ſeeing that hee had brought himſelf into a <hi>Premunire,</hi> and that no leſs than his <hi>Life</hi> was concerned; <hi>See Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>if that bee hee which hath done ſuch havock in the Priſon;</hi> Then ten or twelve alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went in with their Arms in their hands, where <hi>Humbertus</hi> Captain of the <hi>Guards</hi> knowing <hi>Liante</hi> (having ſeen him often in <hi>Podolia</hi>) ſtood amazed, thinking that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> his Executioners had reduced him to that extremity, to force him to ſuffer the affront, which they were commanded to do him: But ſeeing none of them, and onely the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-People, Wee ſhall finde</hi> (ſaid hee to his Companions) <hi>that they have given that barbarous</hi> Commiſſion <hi>to theſe villanous</hi> Boors, <hi>holding it too baſe an Office for them to execute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereupon Hee ſaid to the <hi>Peaſants; Friends, what dee you intend to do with this</hi> Gentleman? <hi>why do you uſe him thus cruelly? It is no</hi> Man, replied one of the Clowns, <hi>but a mad</hi> Woman, <hi>who had almost spoiled us all with a</hi> Knife, <hi>there never was any ſuch</hi> Fury <hi>in the</hi> World. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> thought that was an <hi>illuſion,</hi> hearing him ſtyle a <hi>Woman,</hi> one whom hee ſaw in <hi>Man's</hi> Cloaths, and whom hee held to bee a <hi>Man; Signor Liante,</hi> ſaid hee to the Priſoner lying on the ground, <hi>is it you, and do you not know mee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhould I know you,</hi> replied hee, <hi>that do not know myſelf? For, all theſe</hi> People <hi>will make mee believe</hi> per force <hi>that I am a</hi> Woman, <hi>although I am moſt certain of the</hi> contrary. <hi>Infallibly,</hi> ſaid <hi>Humbertus</hi> to the others with him, <hi>this poor</hi> Gentleman <hi>is become diſtracted, not beeing able to preſerve his</hi> Judgement <hi>entire, after that horrible</hi> affront <hi>which they have made him ſuffer; For, beeing no longer a</hi> Man, <hi>hee denie's that hee is a</hi> Woman, <hi>which indeed hee is not however.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſpeaking again to <hi>Liante, Sir,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>who brought you into this place? my own fooliſh Will,</hi> ſaid Liante. <hi>Who put you in</hi> Priſon <hi>and committed you into the power of theſe</hi> People? <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> anſwered Liante, <hi>I know not whether his intention bee to rid Himſelf of Mee thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This made <hi>Humbertus</hi> preſently conjecture, that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had an hand in the <hi>Plot</hi> with <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> to purchaſe to himſelf <hi>Liante's</hi> whole
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51476:118"/> Eſtate by vertue of his Marriage with <hi>Modeſtina.</hi> Therefore not to dive any further into the buſineſs before ſo many hearers, he left <hi>Liante</hi> under the Guard of two of his company, telling them, <hi>that he muſt firſt ſee the</hi> Palatine, or <hi>ſpeak with</hi> Boleſlaus.</p>
               <p>So going forth hee ſeized upon the <hi>Judge,</hi> and told him, <hi>that hee muſt ſhew him where the</hi> PALATINE <hi>was. What</hi> Palatine? ſaid hee. <hi>Ha?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Humbertus</hi> roughly, <hi>there's no jeſting nor trifling with mee, I ask for</hi> IPHIGENES <hi>Governour of this</hi> Palatinate, <hi>who is</hi> Priſoner <hi>here. Sir,</hi> anſwered the Judge, <hi>if I were to die immediately, I am not able to tell you where hee is, nor what hee is; For, hee is one whom I never ſaw. At leaſt,</hi> ſaid Humbertus, <hi>you ſhall let mee ſee</hi> Him <hi>that wrote mee this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee is an old</hi> Man. The <hi>Judge</hi> having demanded to ſee the <hi>Letter,</hi> and having read it, <hi>Ah! treacherous old Man,</hi> cried hee, <hi>are theſe the Mountaines of</hi> Gold <hi>which thou wer't to bring forth?</hi> Then without farther intreaty (<hi>his Meſſenger</hi> deſiring him to releaſe him out of his <hi>pain</hi>) hee conducted <hi>Humbertus</hi> with his attendants to <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who in few words gave him the full Relation of their <hi>Comicall Chace,</hi> their ſeverall diſguiſes, and their impriſonment, which had like to have had a <hi>Tragicall</hi> concluſion.</p>
               <p>Then reſigning his place to the <hi>Judge,</hi> Sir, ſaid <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> to <hi>Humber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Let us now go directly to the</hi> Palatine; <hi>For, although for his</hi> paſtime <hi>hee hath been</hi> Author <hi>of all this, I fear his own</hi> trouble <hi>is not the leaſt, and when hee is free wee ſhall eaſily releaſe the reſt.</hi> This ſaid, the <hi>Judge,</hi> beeing Manacled, was forced to go before to ſhew them where hee had put <hi>Madam Serife;</hi> For, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> who knew the ſecret, told him, <hi>that</hi> ſhee was the <hi>Palatine</hi> whom they ſought, and <hi>that</hi> now hee ſhould make him believe by good tokens thoſe verities, which hee before ſo much ſlighted and laughed at.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Serife</hi> ſaw <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> entring into her room; <hi>Ah! Father,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>what good</hi> Angell <hi>hath brought you hither to releaſe mee out of this</hi> Captivity, <hi>where I was in the greateſt perplexity imaginable?</hi> Whereupon <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> told her his <hi>Stratagem</hi> in ſending for that <hi>Troop,</hi> which was commanded by <hi>Humbertus,</hi> who attended her pleaſure at the dore. <hi>O Father,</hi> ſaid Iphigenes, <hi>ſuffer him not to come in, For, I ſhould bee yet more afflicted if hee ſhould ſee mee in</hi> Woman's <hi>Cloaths; bid him command one of the</hi> Guards <hi>to give mee</hi> his <hi>and let him take one of the</hi> Peaſant's <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, that I may quickly get out of this</hi> Dungeon, <hi>where I have indured ſo much unworthineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This command was preſently performed, and <hi>Iphigenes</hi> appeared
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51476:118"/> in the form of <hi>Iphis,</hi> not of <hi>Serife,</hi> before her <hi>Guards.</hi> Shee was no ſooner out, but <hi>Paſſion</hi> made her ask for <hi>Liante. Alas Sir,</hi> ſaid Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus, <hi>I left him in the</hi> Priſon <hi>with two Souldiers to guard him, but hee is in a pittifull</hi> condition, <hi>I cannot but grieve at his diſaſter, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne's not us to contradict our</hi> Maſter's <hi>will. How, in a pittifull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Sir,</hi> ſaid Humbertus, <hi>your</hi> Grandeur <hi>knowe's better than I the whole ſtory. Tell mee,</hi> Humbertus (<hi>replied</hi> Iphigenes) <hi>what ſtory?</hi> Then the <hi>Captain</hi> related to him, what hee had heard of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> order in <hi>Plocens,</hi> which hee believed his <hi>Father</hi> would not have commanded without communicating it to him.</p>
               <p>This ſo troubled <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that hee could not bee ſatisfied without going to ſee him, notwithſtanding <hi>Humbertus</hi> diſwaded him all hee could; beeing come to <hi>Liante's</hi> Priſon, where hee found a multitude of <hi>Clowns</hi> crouding in, hee commanded his <hi>Souldiers</hi> to ſeize upon them all, and advancing neer <hi>Liante,</hi> who lay upon the ground all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>duſt,</hi> and loaden with <hi>Irons; What is the matter, Brother,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>in what equipage do I ſee you? Theſe are your sports,</hi> replied <hi>Liante</hi> angerly, <hi>you may end them when you pleaſe, but I am ſure they have almoſt ended mee. How ended?</hi> ſaid Iphigenes. <hi>It was this infamous Generation of Clowniſh Raſcalls,</hi> anſwered Liante, <hi>that hath put mee in the pickle you ſee mee, and if my</hi> paines <hi>are a</hi> pleaſure <hi>to you, you may let mee alone in my</hi> miſery, Death <hi>it ſelf will bee welcom to mee if it proceed from your</hi> Hand <hi>or</hi> Order: <hi>But you would oblige mee very much to ſend mee into the</hi> Wars, <hi>where I might loſe my</hi> Life <hi>with</hi> Honour, <hi>and not bee</hi> butchered <hi>by theſe</hi> Ox-drivers.</p>
               <p>All this was a Riddle to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Boleſlaüs;</hi> for, having been kept every one in a ſeverall room, they knew nothing of each other's ſufferings. And it beeing then no time to ſtand long in Diſcourſe, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> contented himſelf to proteſt to <hi>Liante,</hi> that <hi>hee was innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the</hi> cauſe <hi>of that</hi> impriſonment, <hi>whereof hee was not then to</hi> repent; <hi>but,</hi> that <hi>hee was in no wiſe conſenting to the treacherous deſign of</hi> Mieſlas, <hi>which hee would moſt evidently make appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What do you talke to mee of Mieſlas,</hi> Replied <hi>Liante,</hi> whileſt they were looſing his bands, <hi>I think that Sorcerer</hi> Arcade <hi>hath inchanted you as well as mee, and hath made you believe I know not what ſtory of your</hi> Father <hi>concerning mee, which is the moſt ridiculous</hi> Tale <hi>that e're I heard. Is it not ſo then?</hi> ſaid Iphigenes, <hi>What,</hi> Brother? <hi>have you not been in the hands of</hi> Mieſlas <hi>his ſervants? I have neither ſeen</hi> Mieſlas, <hi>nor any that have relation to him, onely</hi> Arcade (<hi>whom they brought hither to mee
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51476:119"/> th'other day) told mee that hee was at</hi> Plocens, <hi>and that hee had cauſed me to be apprehended there, with ſeverall other idle circumſtances, which cannot proceed but from a diſtracted</hi> Brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have then no other harm than what theſe</hi> Peaſants <hi>have done you,</hi> ſaid Iphigenes: <hi>Or than you have made them do mee,</hi> continued Liante, <hi>but if I get once free of theſe</hi> bonds, <hi>I'le make them feel the</hi> weight <hi>of my</hi> Fingers. <hi>Have you no other wounds than what wee ſee?</hi> ſaid Iphigenes, <hi>No other,</hi> anſwered hee, <hi>but if I had not been ſuccoured in time, and if</hi> Humbertus <hi>had not appeared when hee did (but you gave him his juſt time that your</hi> Game <hi>might bee compleat) they threatned to do mee the greateſt</hi> affront <hi>that ever was offered to any</hi> Man, <hi>and expoſe my</hi> Body <hi>naked to the view of every</hi> Paſſenger, <hi>and not ſatisfied with that</hi> ſhame, <hi>which I hold worſe than</hi> Death, <hi>they purpoſed to make mee</hi> die <hi>publickly by the</hi> authority <hi>of the</hi> Juſtice, <hi>againſt which they taxed mee for having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a</hi> Rebellion (<hi>in defending my ſelf against their</hi> inſolences) <hi>which they ſaid could be no otherwiſe waſhed away than in my own</hi> Blood; <hi>but all this I believe was but to fright mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Humbertus</hi> ſaid ſoftly to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> Sir <hi>there is nothing more certain than that</hi> Mieſlas <hi>ſervants have delivered him into theſe</hi> Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant's <hi>hands, to execute that ſhamefull Commandement which hee had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them. If it bee ſo,</hi> replied <hi>Iphigenes</hi> aloud, <hi>I will make them bee hanged immediately in my own preſence. If you do not,</hi> anſwered Calliante, <hi>I ſhall ſay that you had a hand in it, and though I were to bee hewed in a thouſand pieces, there is not one of them but I will ſheath my Sword in his Bowells, the injurious words and unworthy treatment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have violated my</hi> Patience, <hi>cannot bee ſatisfied with any leſs</hi> Vengeance; <hi>For, what command ſoever you gave them to torment mee, I am confident they have exceeded their</hi> Commiſſion, <hi>and uſed mee worſe than they were injoyned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſumme, not to dwell any longer in theſe lawleſs proceedings of that <hi>corrupt Juſtice,</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Priſoners</hi> beeing releaſed, when they leaſt expected it, after ſome mutuall Conferences and Communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reſpective Sufferings in <hi>Priſon;</hi> the matter was decided to the confuſion of the <hi>Judge,</hi> and all the Inhabitants of that Village, who were as <hi>Blanke</hi> at this alteration as <hi>Bell-founders</hi> when their Mettalls anſwer not their Expectation. IPHIGENES was acknowledged to bee <hi>Palatine</hi> of that <hi>Country; Almeria</hi> known to bee <hi>Liante</hi> (but onely to <hi>Humbertus</hi> and ſome few others, who were injoyned to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under pain of the <hi>Palatine's</hi> high diſpleaſure) and <hi>Arcade</hi> found
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51476:119"/> a true and faithfull ſervant, beeing confronted with <hi>Humbertus.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting but <hi>Halters</hi> to hang thoſe <hi>Clowns,</hi> and the <hi>Judge</hi> higher than the reſt: Which <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> beeing preſſed by the conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Calliante</hi> and the other <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> would have had executed forthwith.</p>
               <p>The chiefe Actors were preſently apprehended, as the <hi>Judge</hi> and his inſeparable ſhadowes, the <hi>Clarks,</hi> and other blood-ſucking Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, with <hi>Celian's</hi> Sons and the three <hi>Harpies,</hi> beſides ſome others which were found <hi>Complices</hi> of their <hi>inſolences;</hi> of whom the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to revenge the <hi>Palatine,</hi> choſe each of them one, to tie him to the branches of the next Tree.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Ruſticks</hi> who were a little before ſuch inſulting <hi>Tyrants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came now humble <hi>Petitioners,</hi> and begged pardon upon their Knees, making many <hi>excuſes,</hi> pleading <hi>ignorance</hi> and condemning their <hi>raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Calliante,</hi> ſeconded by <hi>Pomeran, Piſides</hi> and <hi>Argal,</hi> cryed out for nothing but <hi>Vengeance</hi> and ſodain <hi>Execution,</hi> every one relating the particular affronts they had received: Onely <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> more diſcreet then thoſe young fiery <hi>Spirits,</hi> harkened attentively to what they ſaid without uttering a ſillable, untill <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſaid, <hi>What?</hi> Father, <hi>do you ſay</hi> nothing?</p>
               <p>To this hee replied, <hi>It is not that I have not had my ſhare of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Cup as well as the reſt, but me-think's the</hi> Sun <hi>hath now given place to the</hi> Night, <hi>as it were, on purpoſe to give us</hi> Counſell, <hi>and ſomewhat ſettle the</hi> motions <hi>which agitate our ſeverall</hi> thoughts; that <hi>which is done in cold</hi> Blood <hi>is alwayes riper and more</hi> conſiderate <hi>than what is acted in heat of</hi> Paſſion.

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:51476:120"/> cruelty <hi>of the</hi> Roman Emperours, <hi>who at their Feaſts made the</hi> Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, <hi>in their</hi> preſence, <hi>feed their</hi> Eyes with humane Blood, <hi>whileſt they were filling their</hi> Bellies <hi>with the</hi> Fleſh <hi>of</hi> Beaſts.

               <p>What? ſaid Iphigenes, <hi>ſhall ſuch</hi> crimes <hi>then paſs unpuniſhed? by no means,</hi> anſwered Boleſlaus, <hi>I would not have you bee inſenſible of their</hi> miſdemeanours, <hi>but I adviſe you onely ſo to manage your</hi> Chaſtiſements, <hi>that your</hi> Enviers <hi>may finde no occaſion to defame your manner of</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>and caſt you farther into the</hi> King's <hi>disfavour than you are.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What? ſhall this wicked</hi> Judge <hi>then eſcape for ſuch abominable extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> ſaid Liante; <hi>I will rather ſtrangle him with my own</hi> Hands, <hi>then that the</hi> World <hi>ſhall be infeſted any longer with ſuch an</hi> Harpy; <hi>And wee,</hi> ſaid the other Gentlemen, <hi>will do as much to thoſe other</hi> Monſters, <hi>who have nothing of</hi> humane <hi>but their</hi> ſhapes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> anſwered Boleſlaus, <hi>to ſtop the boyling of your irritated</hi> bloods, <hi>there is a way to content you, to puniſh them ſufficiently, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the</hi> Honour <hi>and</hi> Reputation <hi>of the</hi> Palatine. This propoſition ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving procured all their attentions, hee coninued thus: <hi>Do not you think the fear of</hi> Death, <hi>will bee a</hi> puniſhment <hi>anſwerable to the</hi> pains <hi>which they have made us ſuffer, and into which indeed wee caſt our ſelves for our own</hi> pleaſures? <hi>whereunto if you adde the</hi> Laſh <hi>or the</hi> Strapado <hi>with a perpetuall</hi> Baniſhment, <hi>I do not ſee but that you may be throughly</hi> ſatisfied, <hi>they rigorouſly enough</hi> puniſhed, <hi>and that thoſe who ſhall hear of this</hi> penalty <hi>and their</hi> offence, <hi>will not have occaſion rather to applaud the</hi> Palatine's Mercie <hi>and</hi> Prudence, <hi>than condemn his</hi> rigour. <hi>And for the</hi> Judge, <hi>I confeſs hee deſerve's</hi> Death <hi>by all</hi> humane <hi>Lawes; but if you conſider how his caſe is linked with the</hi> Peaſant's, <hi>and that by your</hi> diſguiſements <hi>you puzled their</hi> underſtandings <hi>you will finde</hi> that <hi>if they are not worthy of</hi> Grace <hi>for their own ſakes, you ought to</hi> pardon <hi>them for the</hi> Love <hi>of your ſelves, ſince by your ſecret</hi> connivance <hi>you did in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner make them tumble into the</hi> ditch <hi>of</hi> Error, <hi>which led them into theſe</hi> exorbitances.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:51476:120"/>
               <p>At laſt <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> by his mild and diſcreet Arguments ſtopt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of their wrath, as heaps of ſoft Earth uſe to ſtifle <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>-bullets, and perſwaded thoſe high <hi>Spirits</hi> to condeſcend to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances. So <hi>Night</hi> beeing far ſpent, they ſettled themſelves to reſt, reſolving to put his advice in Execution next morning.</p>
               <p>In mean time, the Trances and Agonies, which the apprehenſion of <hi>Death</hi> made the <hi>Country</hi>-People feel, were beyond expreſſion. The <hi>Day</hi> which rejoiceth all the <hi>World</hi> was odious to them, as that, which was to veile their Eyes with an everlaſting <hi>Night:</hi> But <hi>Heavens</hi> provided for them otherwiſe then they expected. For, to give them a full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of fear, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> commanded they ſhould bee all hanged forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon trees neer their own dwellings, which the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were very ready to execute; but, as they were about to give them the <hi>ſwing, Boleſlaüs</hi> and the other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> caſt themſelves at the <hi>Palatine's</hi> feet, to beg their <hi>Lives,</hi> of which, Apprehenſion had almoſt bereaved them already. Then came the deplorable <hi>Celian</hi> watering his hoary-Beard with tears, and proſtrating himſelf before <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> beſeeched him by all that was moſt ſacred in <hi>Heaven</hi> and on <hi>Earth,</hi> not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of all his children at once, and quite extinguiſh thoſe ſparks, by whom hee hoped to revive in his Poſterity.</p>
               <p>This ſupplication was ſeconded with the lamentable <hi>cries</hi> of the three <hi>Searchers,</hi> who were tied to their ſeverall <hi>Gibets</hi> like the reſt; the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> (painted on their <hi>Faces,</hi> and which danced before their <hi>Eyes</hi>) touched with ſome <hi>compaſſion</hi> thoſe who were the day before ſo eager for <hi>revenge,</hi> deriving all the fault upon the <hi>Judge,</hi> who eſcaped very narrowly beeing ſacrificed to <hi>Example,</hi> and having been (as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew's</hi> Emiſſary <hi>Goat</hi>) loaden with the Faults and Maledictions of all the People. But in ſtead of periſhing for the reſt, hee had his <hi>grace</hi> as well as they, a diſgracefull <hi>grace,</hi> yet <hi>juſt</hi> and full of equity.</p>
               <p>For, if their lives were given them, it was to prolong it by a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which thoſe that are happy in a <hi>Country,</hi> and who love their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> ſoile, would eſteem worſe than <hi>Death:</hi> It was <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> which was ſo dreadfull to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they thought it was to <hi>die,</hi> to <hi>live</hi> out of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis true, that with <hi>poor</hi> People it is as with thoſe that are extreamly <hi>generous,</hi> to whom every <hi>Land</hi> is their <hi>Country,</hi> as the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Fiſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before the pronouncing of this <hi>ſentence,</hi> (which could not but bee ſweet to thoſe that were recalled from the <hi>Sepulcher</hi>) It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, to ſpare the pains of fetching <hi>Surgeons,</hi> preſently to let blood
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51476:121"/> thoſe People, whom the fear of <hi>Death</hi> had caſt into a violent <hi>Feaver,</hi> to recommend them to the <hi>diſcretion</hi> or rather <hi>indiſcretion</hi> of the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> who to ſave <hi>rods,</hi> laced their ſhoulders ſo well with their <hi>ſtirrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leathers,</hi> that they made them ſwim in their own <hi>blood,</hi> which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the <hi>Wine</hi> they drank ſome dayes before in ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. And the three <hi>Shepherdeſſes,</hi> deputed for that <hi>ſearch,</hi> had their ſhare of this whipping-<hi>cheer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this blooding, ſix Souldiers were appointed to conduct them forthwith to <hi>Danzic,</hi> to bee imbarked and tranſported thence into <hi>Moſcovia</hi> (a Country more rude and barbarous than <hi>Sarmatia</hi>) there to continue to perpetuity, under pain of beeing Hanged if ever they returned. Where they remained untill <hi>Iphigenes's</hi> re-eſtabliſhment at <hi>Court,</hi> who then conſidering that they were ſufficiently puniſhed, ſent them his <hi>Grace,</hi> and permitted them to repoſſeſs their former Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

                  <hi>I can believe no other</hi> (ſaid Mieſlas) <hi>but the</hi> Women <hi>are not ſo ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For, beeing the pure</hi> ſubſtance <hi>of</hi> infirmity, <hi>they preſently take the</hi> allarme, <hi>and ſeizing on the</hi> Fire-brand <hi>by the burning end, they construe every action in the worst ſenſe.

                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> having brought him to the point, whereof hee deſired with much impatience to bee ſatisfied, deferred not to aske him, how <hi>Liante</hi> happened into his Hands? <hi>Mieſlas</hi> thereupon told him, that coming to <hi>Plocens</hi> hee found him there, expecting his return from Hunting. <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwered Iphigenes, <hi>did hee tell you that hee came to ſee me? No,</hi> ſaid Mieſlas, <hi>for I ſaw him not, but thus he ſaid to thoſe whom I ſent to apprehend him.

That</hi> Deſign, ſaid Iphigenes, <hi>is very ſevere, and it is to be feared, that being divulged (as it is no eaſie matter to conceal ſuch actions long) it will produce one of theſe two miſchiefs; either that it will caſt you into the</hi> King's <hi>disfavour, (who doubtleſs will abhor ſo ſtrange a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) or elſe that the</hi> deſpair <hi>of ſo</hi> inhumane <hi>a</hi> violence, <hi>may make that poor</hi> Gentleman <hi>reſolve to preſerve his own</hi> Life to <hi>take away yours, and</hi> revenge <hi>himſelf at what rate ſoever of that</hi> affront, <hi>which is the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any</hi> Man <hi>can indure.</hi>

               <p>Night ſummoning every one to a Retreat, a <hi>Page</hi> came to acquaint <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that there was a <hi>Lady</hi> in the Hall, who deſired to ſpeak with him about ſome buſineſs of great importance. <hi>Hee,</hi> who was all <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,</hi> eſpecially towards <hi>Ladies,</hi> made her not long expect him: But ſhee having intreated him to hear in private what ſhee had to impart to him, hee led her into his Chamber, where ſhee ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the perſon that ſpeak's to you under this <hi>Woman's</hi> habit is a <hi>Man Iphigenes</hi>

                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> anſwered the diſguiſed <hi>Man,</hi> You take mee for another, I am <hi>Menochius,</hi> one of your Mother <hi>Aretuza's</hi> ſervants, appointed to waite upon your <hi>Lady, Modeſtina,</hi> in the Caſtle where your <hi>Father</hi> commanded her to bee kept cloſe Priſoner: There ſhee firſt gained my heart by <hi>Pitty,</hi> then by <hi>preſents,</hi> and laſtly by <hi>promiſes</hi> and <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> that the ſervice ſhee deſired of mee would bee acceptable to you; It was to convey her out of Priſon: which I effected very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, having covered her with one of my Suits; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Horſes in a convenient place not far thence, I conducted her hither, where ſhee commanded mee to take the habit wherein you ſee mee, whileſt ſhee went abroad to inquire after you: And here was confirmed to her the newes, which made her reſolve to finde you out, beeing pricked with <hi>Jealouſie</hi> and the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of loſing you by a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which ſhee was informed, poſſeſſed you for a <hi>Shepherdeſs</hi> in theſe Neighbouring <hi>Foreſts,</hi> whom you were report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been reſolved to marry. But her ill <hi>fortune</hi> was, at the arrivall of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> to bee obſerved by ſome of his followers or yours, and to bee taken by them for <hi>Liante,</hi> by reaſon of her likeneſs to him in Face, and her beeing in <hi>Man's</hi> cloaths. Upon this miſtake ſhee was apprehended by order from <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and I hear that hee hath ſent her back into <hi>Podolia,</hi> to the ſame Caſtle where <hi>Liante</hi> was Priſoner: But when ſhee is known, I believe ſhee will bee ſent where ſhee was before, with her Governeſs <hi>Perpetua.</hi> And I, <hi>My Lord,</hi> remain here deſtitute of all relief, having no <hi>hope</hi> but in your <hi>Pity,</hi> no <hi>confidence</hi> but in your <hi>Mercy.</hi> If I have tranſgreſſed in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her in her deſires (which proceeded onely from the extream and incomparable affection ſhee bears you) I am ready to receive ſuch puniſhment as you ſhall pleaſe to ordain. If your more favourable cenſure judge mee not culpable, I flie for refuge under your Protection againſt the fury of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who will make mee bee torne in pieces, if hee come to know that I have contributed any thing to her eſcape: For, hee dreaded nothing ſo much as to ſee her with you.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Menochius</hi> ended there his Speech, asked him
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51476:125"/> if hee knew no farther news of <hi>Modeſtina? No,</hi> anſwered hee, <hi>For, fearing to diſcover my ſelf, I durſt not inquire after any other particulars.</hi> By this Diſcourſe <hi>Iphigenes</hi> preſently perceived what gave the riſe to that Report, which <hi>Arcade</hi> brought him into the Priſon, and the veile fell from thoſe <hi>Enigma's,</hi> which held his imagination in ſuſpenſe. But this was to him a falling out of the <hi>Frying-pan</hi> into the <hi>Fire:</hi> for as his <hi>Paſſion</hi> for <hi>Liante</hi> was great, ſo his <hi>Affection</hi> to <hi>Modeſtina</hi> was not ordinary; and if hee would have deſired to change his <hi>Sex,</hi> it ſhould have been meerly for her ſake, and to bee really her <hi>Husband;</hi> none among all the <hi>Ladies</hi> hee had ever ſeen deſerving more than <hi>Modeſtina</hi> to poſſeſs his <hi>Body</hi> as well as his <hi>Heart.</hi> And indeed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had loſt much of the glory of his ſweet Diſpoſition, if hee had done leſs than love Her, who beſides their long education together, the conformity of their humours, and the bond of their <hi>Souls,</hi> came to give him ſo remarkeable an evidence of her <hi>Love,</hi> expoſing her <hi>perſon</hi> to ſo many perills to ſeek him, &amp; enjoy the felicity of his Preſence. So <hi>Liante</hi> being already ſecured from his <hi>Father's</hi> rage, all his care was bent towards <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> as the <hi>Object</hi> which had moſt need of his ſuccour; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſmiſſed <hi>Menochius,</hi> after adviſing him to continue in that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> habit, and ſtir little abroad untill <hi>Mieſlas</hi> were returned to <hi>Court,</hi> promiſing him his Protection and Aſſiſtance againſt whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and in acknowledgement of the ſervice which hee had rendred to <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> hee filled his hand with a good ſumme of <hi>Gold,</hi> as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the favours hee would do him, aſſuring him in mean time to exempt him from <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which done, hee caſt himſelf upon his Bed, overwhelmed with ſuch a multitude of thoughts, that his <hi>Eye-lids</hi> were hardly cloſed all <hi>night;</hi> For, his <hi>Heart</hi> beeing divided betwixt <hi>Modestina</hi> and <hi>Liante,</hi> and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended like a piece of <hi>Iron</hi> between two <hi>Load-ſtones,</hi> hee knew not which way to incline his reſolution. This reſtleſneſs of <hi>Mind</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repoſe to his <hi>Body,</hi> hee ſent very early in the Morning for <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> to take advice of that faithfull <hi>Councellour,</hi> how hee ſhould ſhape his <hi>courſe</hi> in that <hi>tempeſtuous</hi> occurrence.

To poſt preſently to her relief, had been to contradict what hee had made the <hi>Princeſs</hi> and his <hi>Father</hi> believe of his ſlender eſteem of that <hi>Wife,</hi> from whom hee ſeemed to them to deſire nothing more than a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51476:126"/> 
                  <hi>ſeparation:</hi> Not to go, and not to aſſiſt her in ſo urgent a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> hee deemed an <hi>ingratitude</hi> not to bee digeſted by any generous <hi>Spirit.</hi> On the other ſide beeing too well acquainted with the <hi>cruelty</hi> of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and the <hi>deſign</hi> hee had againſt <hi>Liante,</hi> hee began to think that hee had not provided ſufficiently for his <hi>ſafety,</hi> keeping him ſo neer that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable <hi>Sarmatian.</hi> And although <hi>Palatines</hi> (who are incontroule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their own <hi>Governments</hi>) have no authority in another's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; yet the quality of <hi>Father</hi> gave <hi>Mieſlas</hi> I know not what privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in that of <hi>Plocens,</hi> which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> would not have permitted to another.</p>
               <p>Having communicated all theſe painfull imaginations to <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> hee anſwered; <q>My Lord, it happen's oft-times that recreative ſports are the <hi>preſages,</hi> and as I may ſay, the <hi>Prologues</hi> of more ſerious oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences: It was your <hi>pleaſure</hi> to make your's lately in the <hi>Forest,</hi> and perchance it is the <hi>Heaven's</hi> Will now to act their part.

Indeed it would require the thred of a greater <hi>Prudence</hi> than mine to conduct us ſafely forth; But ſince you do mee the <hi>honour</hi> to believe mee, my <hi>fidelity</hi> having been approved by you.

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwered Iphigenes, <hi>Every one act's according to his</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>and is the Artificer of his own good or bad</hi> Fortune; <hi>I will not ground</hi> mine <hi>upon the</hi> maximes <hi>which</hi> you <hi>hold, nor therein imitate</hi> your <hi>ways.

                  <hi>This diſcourſe,</hi> ſaid Mieſlas, <hi>is the</hi> Child <hi>of your</hi> Scruples, <hi>and proceed's from the little experience you have yet in</hi> Worldly <hi>affairs.

                  <hi>I ſay ſtill,</hi> anſwered Iphigenes, <hi>that I never was greatly in love with</hi> Modeſtina <hi>but my</hi> Friendſhip <hi>can admit of no</hi> out-vier: <hi>For, if our</hi> Faces <hi>tan inſenſibly by beeing in the</hi> Sun, <hi>and</hi> cloaths <hi>are</hi> perfumed <hi>by lying neer ſweet</hi> odours, <hi>it is impoſſible but that the long</hi> education <hi>you have given us together, ſhould have planted in my</hi> Soul <hi>the roots of</hi> affection, <hi>which make's mee deſire her</hi> happineſs, <hi>and deteſt that which doth her</hi> miſchief; <hi>I may ſay with much</hi> truth, <hi>I love her as my</hi> Siſter, <hi>and by the ſame reaſon</hi> Liante <hi>as my</hi> Brother, <hi>and in this quality wee have ſo often

               <p>Hereupon <hi>Mieſlas</hi> beeing ready to burſt with <hi>rage,</hi> and thundering out no ſmall <hi>Oaths,</hi> ſaid; <hi>Wee ſhall ſee</hi> (Gallant) <hi>if</hi> Liante <hi>ever fall into my</hi> clutches, <hi>how you will hinder mee from executing my</hi> will <hi>upon him.

               <p>After much other diſcourſe to the ſame effect, they parted very little ſatisfied of each other. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> went to ſee the <hi>Princeſs,</hi> to whom, though hee diſſembled, hee could render no pleaſing account, which put her into ſuch diſtemper, as may bee imagined in a <hi>Woman</hi> of her <hi>Spirit,</hi> haughty by reaſon of the <hi>nobleneſs</hi> of her <hi>extraction, eminence</hi> of her <hi>dignity,</hi> and the vaſtneſs of her <hi>Eſtate;</hi> beſides all which beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with <hi>Love,</hi> and yet who perceived through all theſe advantages, her <hi>affections</hi> repayed with ſome kind of <hi>ſlight.</hi>

               <p>VVhile ſhee is ſpending her Breath in <hi>Sighs,</hi> and thirſting like <hi>Tantalus</hi> in the midſt of pleaſant <hi>Waters;</hi> Let us go ſee how <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> hath diſcharged the Commiſſion of his <hi>Embaſſie.</hi> Beeing arrived where <hi>Liante,</hi> by Order of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> was concealed; <hi>Father,</hi> ſaid the young Gentleman, <hi>your appearance rejoiceth mee no leſs than</hi> Phebus <hi>doth the</hi> VVorld, <hi>when hee chaſeth away the</hi> ſhades <hi>wherewith the</hi> Night <hi>had covered the</hi> Face <hi>of the</hi> Earth. <hi>This laſt</hi> Night <hi>I had the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi> Dream, <hi>and which put mee in the greatest paine of any I can remember; For, mee thought that beeing eſcaped out of the</hi> clawes <hi>of thoſe</hi> Harpies, <hi>which I belaboured ſo handſomely in our</hi> Country-priſon, <hi>I was fallen into the</hi> Hands <hi>of thoſe barbarous</hi> Ruſticks, <hi>who ſearching mee, bound as I was, found mee to be a</hi> Woman, <hi>which bred a ſtrange</hi> Agony <hi>in my</hi> Thoughts; <hi>For I ſpeak really, I had rather imbrace</hi> Death, <hi>than be ſubiect to their ſad</hi> Condition: <hi>And that which troubled mee moſt, was that</hi> brutall <hi>newes which</hi> Arcade <hi>brought us of the Deſign</hi> Mieſlas <hi>had againſt mee, which my</hi> Fancy <hi>made mee believe thoſe raſcalls had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on my perſon. But, wakening put mee out of all pain, and your arrivall, unveiling all theſe</hi> Enigma's, <hi>will ſet my</hi> Thoughts <hi>at reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I never was with</hi> Artemidorus <hi>of</hi> Morpheus <hi>Councill,</hi> ſaid Boleſlaus, <hi>but it is probable that by ſome kinde of</hi> tranſpiration, <hi>or by the means of</hi> Spirits <hi>things acted at a diſtance are conveyed to perſons abſent, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them in their</hi> ſleep <hi>with ſtrange</hi> diſguiſements. <hi>Your</hi> Dream <hi>is but too true; for, that</hi> Liante (<hi>of whoſe diſaſter</hi> Arcade <hi>brought us notice) is no other than your</hi> Siſter, <hi>who came in</hi> Man's <hi>apparrell to ſeek her</hi> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>beeing prick't with</hi> Jealouſie <hi>for</hi> Almeria; <hi>the poor</hi> Lady <hi>had made her eſcape out of</hi> Priſon, <hi>but at</hi> Mieſlas <hi>arrivall at</hi> Plocens, <hi>ſhee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for you, and delivered into the</hi> Hands <hi>of ſome</hi> Villains <hi>who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to execute what</hi> Arcade <hi>told us: But, I believe, if their</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm <hi>tranſport them to the</hi> impudence <hi>of a</hi> ſearch, <hi>finding themſelves miſtaken, the apprehenſion of being ſeverely puniſhed by</hi> Ighigenes <hi>will make them ſeek their</hi> ſecurity <hi>by</hi> flight.</p>
               <p>If this newes doubly diſtempered <hi>Liante,</hi> I give him leave to judge who know's how ſenſible to a <hi>Bother</hi> that's full of <hi>honour,</hi> is an affront offered to his <hi>Siſter:</hi> Beſides, conſidering how much more precious the <hi>Skin</hi> is then the <hi>Shirt,</hi> the danger whereunto hee ſaw himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the rigour and proximity of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> agitated his <hi>mind</hi> with no ſmall perplexities. Hee would have inquired divers particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> but <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> could informe him no farther than
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51476:132"/> what hee had learned by the relations of <hi>Menochius</hi> and <hi>Arcade:</hi> Onely hee aſſured him <hi>that Iphigenes</hi> intended an exemplary revenge againſt thoſe inhumane inſtruments of his <hi>Father's</hi> cruelty, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any outragious act upon the perſon of her who was ſo dear to him. And as for him, <hi>that</hi> hee came purpoſely to let him underſtand, that the <hi>Palatine</hi> would expoſe his own <hi>Life</hi> in his defence againſt the rigours of <hi>Mieſlas;</hi> by whom hee need not fear to bee ſurpiſed, as well in regard <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was more powerfull than hee in his own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> could not learn where he was, thoſe ſame <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> whom hee had ſeen in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> beeing ſtill in the opinion that he was <hi>Almeria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe reaſons, <hi>fear</hi> made ſo hot an allarm in the poor <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Heart, that <hi>confidence</hi> could finde no admittance. Hee was too well acquainted with the imperious and brutall humour of his <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> Guardian to truſt him, the experience of his long impriſonment and unworthy treatment formerly, repreſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves feelingly to his <hi>Memory.</hi> Inſomuch that thinking his onely ſafety was in his heeles hee determined by withdrawing himſelf ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of that <hi>Province,</hi> (where he had paſſed ſo many perills) to ſecure his perſon from the violence of that <hi>Tempeſt.</hi> Nevertheleſs hee pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſſembled his reſolution to <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> leſt hee ſhould divert his deſign by perſwaſions, or oppoſe it by the authority of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that after ſome other diſcourſe, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> (thinking that hee had ſufficiently pacified his thoughts by the aſſurance of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) took leave of him to return to <hi>Plocens,</hi> whence hee promiſed to give him frequent intelligence of what paſſed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Liante,</hi> who ſtudied nothing more than to be out of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> reach, eaſily accompliſhed the deſign of his ſecurity: For, not beeing <hi>Priſoner</hi> in that Caſtle, it was no difficult matter to ſteal away from thoſe, who were commanded to defend, not to detein his perſon. And doubtleſs it was not without the ſuggeſtion of ſome good <hi>Angell,</hi> that hee ſo ſodainly took the reſolution of leaving that fatall coaſt, which was no leſs dangerous to him, then <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi> are to thoſe <hi>Mariners</hi> that ſaile through the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>For, whether <hi>Mieſlas</hi> would revenge himſelf upon that imaginary <hi>Shepherdeſs</hi> for the liberty which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> took in ſpeaking to him, or whether hee conceived <hi>that</hi> ſhee was the main obſtacle that hindered him from anſwering <hi>Reſpicia's</hi> deſires, beeing moved thereunto by her inſtigations, hee ſet ſo many <hi>Engines</hi> to work, that in ſhort time
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51476:133"/> hee learn't where that <hi>Caſtle</hi> was in which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> concealed that ſuppoſed <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi> And it beeing an hard matter to keep long undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a thing done in the preſence of many; whether <hi>Pomeran</hi> out of <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>Palatine's</hi> honour deſired by that means to divert his friend from that <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which hee eſteemed ridiculous; or whether ſome of the Souldiers, corrupted by mony, revealed the ſecret to <hi>Mieſlas;</hi> hee ſtole away from <hi>Plocens</hi> in the <hi>Night,</hi> and beeing well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied hee marched to that <hi>Caſtle,</hi> hee introduced himſelf cunningly under the Name of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> Beeing entred hee asked for <hi>Almeria;</hi> but the inhabitants anſwering him that <hi>Liante</hi> was no longer there, hee thought they mocked him: The <hi>Maſter</hi> of the houſe on the other ſide thought <hi>Mieſlas</hi> mocked him and began to grow angry to ſee himſelf braved in his own Houſe by perſons whom hee knew not, onely they had made uſe of the <hi>Palatine's</hi> Name to facilitate their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> fearing leſt, during thoſe debates, the party whom hee came to ſeek might by ſome ſubtility bee evaded, commanded his followers to ſearch diligently every corner of the <hi>Caſtle.</hi> But neither <hi>Liante</hi> nor <hi>Almeria</hi> could bee found, for they were both retired to a place unknown as well to the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Plocens,</hi> as the cruell <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> of <hi>Podolia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Day had no ſooner opened the watchfull <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Eyes, but beeing informed of his <hi>Father's</hi> nocturnall <hi>chace,</hi> and fearing leſt hee ſhould take his <hi>Turtle</hi> in the <hi>Neſt</hi> you may imagine what perplexities diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his thoughts. But at length <hi>Love</hi> gaining the aſcendant over all other reſpects, made him preſently take Horſe, and having aſſembled as many <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> beſides his <hi>Guards,</hi> as could not but over-power the <hi>Party</hi> which attended <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> hee marched with all ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that <hi>Caſtle,</hi> reſolving to defend his <hi>Friend</hi> againſt the violence of his <hi>Father.</hi> Undoubtedly their incounter had been very bloudy, if hee had found <hi>Liante</hi> taken: For, what would not our <hi>Amazon</hi> have done for the <hi>price</hi> of ſuch a <hi>victory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee arrived at the <hi>Caſtle</hi> juſt as <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> after an exact Search, was coming forth. In his heat <hi>Iphigenes</hi> would have charged his <hi>Father's</hi> Troop without further Examination, beeing determined to reſcue <hi>Liante,</hi> or loſe his <hi>Life:</hi> But <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> tempered that impetuoſity, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him <hi>that</hi> before hee came to ſo deſperate an <hi>effect,</hi> hee ſhould firſt conſider the certainty of the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Then asking ſome of his <hi>Father's</hi> Attendants if <hi>Liante</hi> was taken, hee was anſwered, that <hi>Almeria</hi> was not to bee found. <hi>Paſſion</hi> having too much overbalanced his ſenſes,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51476:133"/> 
                  <hi>I care not for</hi> Almeria (ſaid <hi>Iphigenes) ſo that</hi> Liante <hi>be free, You may well think</hi> (ſaid Boleſlaus in his Ear) <hi>if</hi> Almeria <hi>be not taken, that</hi> Liante <hi>is ſafe enough; For, they go both one way, and under the ſame Cloaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when hee advanced towards <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> that meeting of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> was like to the <hi>oppoſition</hi> of the <hi>Planets</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> whoſe Aſpects dart none but maligne influences. <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion to ſpeak firſt, ſaid to his <hi>Son; I think this is an inchanted</hi> Caſtle, <hi>for the People anſwer all by contraries; I asked for your</hi> Diana, <hi>and they toldmee that</hi> Liante <hi>was no longer there; hath your</hi> Bother-in-law <hi>been in this place then? Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Iphigenes</hi> angerly, <hi>are you come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſearch? ſhew what</hi> Commiſſion <hi>you have from the</hi> King <hi>to that purpoſe, otherwiſe give mee leave to tell you, as</hi> Palatine <hi>of this</hi> Country, <hi>that you have nothing to do to ſeek either of them here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if I had found either of them</hi> (ſaid Mieſlas) <hi>I ſhould have made them knew what my</hi> Power <hi>is, and all your</hi> ſtrength <hi>would have been too</hi> weak <hi>to have taken them out of my</hi> hands. <hi>As beeing my Father</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Iphigenes) <hi>you have priviledge to uſe theſe tearms, But there's none elſe breathing upon</hi> Earth <hi>whom I ſhould not make throughly ſenſible of the</hi> Power <hi>I have in the</hi> Countries <hi>which depend on my</hi> authority. <hi>Therefore,</hi> Sir, <hi>you muſt tell mee if you have taken either of thoſe perſons; For, I will die in the place, or I will make him that hath them in keeping releaſe them; and whatſoever you are able to do or ſay, nothing ſhall hinder mee from cutting in pieces all thoſe that accompany you, if they are not delivered to my hands: For, to ſuffer this breach in my</hi> Charge, <hi>and that before my Face any one ſhould ſeize upon</hi> Perſons <hi>that are under my</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, <hi>is an</hi> affront <hi>which I can leſs indure than</hi> Death.</p>
               <p>This inflamed the fiery <hi>Sarmatian</hi> with ſuch <hi>Fury,</hi> that fetching a <hi>Career</hi> hee had fallen upon <hi>Iphigenes</hi> like an haſty ſtorm, if hee (who was no leſs <hi>dexterous</hi> than the other <hi>fierce</hi>) had not handſomly ſlipped aſide, and let paſs the impetuoſity of that <hi>Torrent.</hi> Then thoſe that attended him interpoſing themſelves to hinder them from joyning, you might have ſeen <hi>Mieſlas</hi> foaming with rage, and brandiſhing his naked Sword, with threats to dip it in his own blood, (that was) in the body of <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> who having not ſo much as laid his hand upon the Guard of his, was reſolved rather to die by his <hi>Father's</hi> hand, than draw his Sword againſt him.</p>
               <p>But as how graceleſs ſoever Children are, yet there remain's ſome raye of <hi>Paternall</hi> reverence in their <hi>Souls;</hi> So in the <hi>Heart</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:51476:134"/> what <hi>Choler</hi> ſoever animate's him againſt his Children, there is a ſecret <hi>Advocate</hi> which plead's their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and make's the Weapons fall out of their hands. This was verified by that occurrence; for, what <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> ſoever tranſported <hi>Mieſlas</hi> at the preſent, hee was afterwards glad of thoſe <hi>Gentlemen's</hi> oppoſing his <hi>fury,</hi> and that they had given his <hi>Indignation</hi> leiſure to appeaſe the impetuoſity of it's violent <hi>Surges,</hi> beeing better ſatisfied to have killed his Son with his <hi>Tongue</hi> then his <hi>hands,</hi> and run him through with <hi>threats</hi> then with his <hi>Rapier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length <hi>Iphigenes</hi> beeing aſſured by the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and the Souldiers, that <hi>Liante</hi> had given them the ſlip the day before, his <hi>mind</hi> was indifferently well pacified, but yet much troubled, that hee knew not whither hee was gone. So, the ſtorm beeing quite blown over, the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> accoſted each other; and <hi>Mieſlas</hi> aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not a little of his rigid haughtineſs, <hi>By</hi>-. (ſaid hee ſwearing deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately) <hi>I think you will force mee to deliver thoſe whom I have not in my power, but if I had, you ſhould aſſoon wreſt the</hi> Club <hi>out of</hi> Hercules <hi>hands, as teare them out of my</hi> clutches. <hi>I bleſs the</hi> Heavens, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iphigenes, that things be in the condition they are: I muſt confeſs I ſhould be much troubled to ſee perſons ill treated in any territories, whoſe preſervation is pretious to mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſaid Mieſlas, <hi>may not I know if that was</hi> Liante? <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwered Iphigenes, <hi>that equivocall appellation deceive's you; it is</hi> Almeria, <hi>who having put on</hi> Man's <hi>cloaths to go a Hunting, and do violent exerciſes with more Freedom and Activity, call's herſelf</hi> Calliante, <hi>which name I impoſed upon her in an humour, it ſignifie's</hi> Fair-Flower. <hi>What,</hi> Fair-Flower? ſaid Mieſlas, <hi>indeed ſhee did well to vaniſh before I came; For, never any</hi> Haile <hi>did ſo much ſpoil in the Vineyards, as my</hi> Blowes <hi>ſhould have done on Her</hi> Shoulders, <hi>if I could have laid hold on</hi> Her.</p>
               <p>With ſome other ſuch like paſſages which wanted not Quips and Jarring words, they re-entred the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Plocens, Iphigenes</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his hand upon his wound, that is, his thoughts continually retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his Loſs of <hi>Liante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pilot</hi> that in the midſt of dangerous <hi>Rocks</hi> is agitated by a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> and from whoſe Eyes the horrid ſhades of <hi>Night</hi> doe hide the twinkling flames of his directing <hi>Star,</hi> is not in greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity then our <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> not knowing which way to ſteer his courſe in purſuit of his dear <hi>Liante.</hi> With what an <hi>Eye</hi> did hee behold the <hi>Princeſs</hi> at his return, eſteeming her the principall cauſe of all theſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51476:134"/> troubles? Hee carried himſelf with ſuch indifference towards her, abating ſo much of thoſe Courteſies, and Compliments, whereof hee was eſteemed the onely <hi>Maſter,</hi> that it was much the <hi>deſpight</hi> of ſeeing her <hi>affection</hi> ſo ill recompenſed, had not cured her of that wound which the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had made in the Center of her <hi>Heart:</hi> But alas! it was incurable, ſince neither <hi>Time, Abſence, Cruelty,</hi> nor <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi> the ſovereign remedies of that <hi>Deſeaſe,</hi> were able to aſſwage the torment of her languiſhing <hi>Pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> very unſatisfied with his <hi>Son's</hi> deportments, reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part next Morning for <hi>Podolia,</hi> as well to give orders concerning the affairs of his <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> as to cauſe <hi>Modestina</hi> to be more ſtrictly garded, &amp; take his Daughter <hi>Clemencia</hi> with him to <hi>Court,</hi> there to attend the <hi>Queen</hi> untill the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> ſhould marry her. And the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia</hi> ſettled her reſolution to return to the <hi>Court</hi> more in love than ever with the <hi>perfections</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> but leſs ſatisfied with his <hi>Courteſie.</hi> Onely <hi>Hope</hi> (which never leaveth us in the midſt of the greateſt diſaſters) ſomewhat appeaſed the tempeſt of that <hi>Ladie's</hi> thoughts, by the aſſurance which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> confirmed to her of making himſelf her's, aſſoon as his <hi>dispenſation</hi> had reſtored him to himſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſame Night ſhee went from <hi>Plocens, Iphigenes</hi> found under the Carpet in his Chamber a note, the Characters and ſenſe whereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the hand and invention of <hi>Respicia;</hi> all the contents were amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous complaints and exclamations againſt inconſtancy, but no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, nor any particular addreſs to him; yet hee needed no <hi>Oedipus</hi> for the expounding of that <hi>Riddle;</hi> hee plainly ſaw <hi>that</hi> ſhee complained of him, but hee feared leſs that <hi>deſpight</hi> would cure her <hi>Love,</hi> than to ſee her <hi>flames</hi> increaſe by the <hi>Ice</hi> of his <hi>neglect. Let her be pleaſed or diſpleaſed,</hi> ſaid hee within himſelf <hi>that concerne's mee little; For, ſooner or later her</hi> error <hi>muſt be manifeſted: and coming at length to underſtand how unable I am to anſwer her</hi> deſires, <hi>that knowledge will make her loſe all farther</hi> hopes. <hi>Oh! that my</hi> miſery <hi>conſiſted onely by beeing in her</hi> Priſon, <hi>then my</hi> diſeaſe <hi>would never trouble; mee, for any mean</hi> medicine <hi>would be able to heal my</hi> wound. <hi>But the</hi> rigour <hi>of my</hi> Fate, <hi>never ceaſing to perſecute mee, make's mee love in ſo ſtrange a manner, that groaning under the pangs of</hi> Death <hi>in my</hi> Martyrdom, <hi>I dare not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my</hi> ſufferings. <hi>Oh! if in the</hi> preſence <hi>of the</hi> Object <hi>which raviſhed mee, and which is now raviſhed from mee with ſo much</hi> cruelty, <hi>I had not the</hi> confidence <hi>to declare my</hi> condition <hi>and my</hi> ſmart, <hi>how ſhould I doe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51476:135"/> it in his</hi> abſence, <hi>and ſuch an</hi> abſence <hi>as is to mee an</hi> abſolute <hi>loſs; ſince in my</hi> diſaſter <hi>I am yet ſo unhappy as not to know where hee is?</hi> Ah! Liante, <hi>could you have the</hi> Heart <hi>to ſteal your ſelf away from the perſon in the</hi> World <hi>which love's you moſt, without leaving mee the</hi> conſolation <hi>of beeing advertiſed where you were retired? For your</hi> flying <hi>and my</hi> following <hi>ſhould have been in the ſame</hi> path; <hi>and if you had flown before as the</hi> Lightning, <hi>I ſhould have come as cloſe after as the</hi> Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps.</p>
               <p>Judge by this diſcourſe how forcible is the attraction of <hi>inclination. Iphigenes</hi> was no more where hee <hi>was,</hi> but where hee <hi>loved;</hi> and as hee knew not where that <hi>was</hi> which hee <hi>loved,</hi> hee knew not well where hee <hi>was</hi> himſelfe; like an <hi>Archer</hi> that ſhoot's without ſeeing the <hi>mark,</hi> or one that run's a race without knowing where to end his <hi>Career.</hi> So great <hi>riches</hi> and ſuch high <hi>honours</hi> as environed him, were but as many <hi>burthens</hi> to the <hi>wings</hi> of his <hi>deſires,</hi> hee would have eſteemed himſelf more <hi>happy,</hi> if his condition had been more <hi>miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To repeat his Exclamations againſt the ſeverity of his <hi>Father,</hi> (who not ſatisfied to have perſecuted him from his birth, ſeemed to aim at nothing but the ruine of his contentments) would bee ſuperfluous. What recreations ſoever <hi>Pomeran,</hi> and his other friends invented to mitigate the ſenſe of his <hi>Affliction,</hi> nothing had the power to divert him from his <hi>Melancholly</hi> muſings. Beeing deprived of the Aſpect of the <hi>Star</hi> of his deſites, nothing but obſcurity and confuſion poſſeſſed his thoughts.</p>
               <p>At length after the revolution of ſome dayes, conſumed in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs diſcontentment, having received no anſwer from the ſeverall places whither hee had ſent to inquire after <hi>Liante,</hi> at a time when hee leaſt expected newes, hee received from the hands of an unkown <hi>Meſſenger</hi> a Paper wherein hee read theſe words.</p>

                        <hi>Since the</hi> Fortuen <hi>of your</hi> Family, <hi>and the</hi> Misfortune <hi>of mine, have conſpired to make mee periſh, be not diſpleaſed</hi> (dear Brother) <hi>that I go to ſeeke in the</hi> Warrs <hi>an honourable</hi> Grave: <hi>the edge of</hi> Mars's <hi>VVeapons cannot cut ſo deep, but

You conceive (I preſume) my meaning, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not expreſs myſelf in any other tearms, leſt this</hi> Paper <hi>ſhould bluſh at that, which cannot bee related with any</hi> Face, <hi>under which remain's the leaſt drop of generous</hi> Blood; <hi>nor projected but by a</hi> Soul <hi>that's abſolutely</hi> Brutall, <hi>it were too little to ſay</hi> Barbarous. <hi>This</hi> Reaſon <hi>is ſufficient to juſtifie my flight, which I never would have undertaken without your privity, could I have given my</hi> Soul <hi>as much</hi> confidence <hi>in your</hi> Power, <hi>as I had of your</hi> Will <hi>to protect mee; and could I have baniſhed from my</hi> apprehenſion <hi>the juſt diſtruſt I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the</hi> fury <hi>of that inhumane</hi> Tartare. <hi>The greateſt diſpleaſure I have, is, that before the</hi> Death, <hi>whereinto I am going to precipitate my ſelf, I could not give you the last</hi> ADIEU, <hi>and aſſure you</hi> that <hi>my</hi> Affection <hi>to you ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive my</hi> Aſhes, <hi>and</hi> that <hi>the</hi> coldneſs <hi>of</hi> Death <hi>ſhall never have the</hi> power <hi>to leſſen it's agreeable</hi> ardours. <hi>If I have not deſerved to</hi> Live <hi>neer you, and in your ſervice, at leaſt it ſhall bee for your ſervice that I</hi> die <hi>thus deſtant from you; too too happy in this laſt indeavour, if I could make you ſee the</hi> oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>which I ſhall</hi> Sacrifiſe <hi>to you of my one</hi> Life. <hi>I know</hi> that <hi>this is the intention of</hi> Mieſlas; <hi>and</hi> that <hi>I can doe nothing through the whole courſe of my</hi> Life, <hi>that will bee more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him than to end it; and thereby ſate his extream cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of having that little fortune which my</hi> Father <hi>left mee.</hi> Oh Heavens! <hi>if the reſigning of my whole Estate to him, would purchaſe mee the happineſs of injoying freely your preſence, how well ſatisfied ſhould I bee?

               <p>Was not this Diſcourſe ſufficient to make our Amorous <hi>Palatine</hi> die with <hi>Love,</hi> had hee not already been overwelmed with <hi>Grief?</hi> Oh ſighs of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> the Winds muſt bee your ſupporters; for, no other Tongue, but that of ſilence is capable of expreſſing you. The words of this Letter were as <hi>Oyle</hi> upon his <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> in the <hi>flames</hi> of his diſquiet <hi>Minde.</hi> Well, <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> you complained, that you had no news from your dear <hi>Liante,</hi> nor what Region hee had

               <p>But for the perfect underſtanding of <hi>Liante's</hi> Letter, and to give light to the ſequele of this <hi>Narration,</hi> I am inforced to make a little Digreſſion in the Hiſtory of thoſe times, to deſcribe the condition wherein <hi>Polonia</hi> then was.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Monarch</hi> of that Kingdom is accuſtomed to add to his Title of <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Polonia,</hi> the ſtyle of great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lithuania, Pruſia</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> although the <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order poſſeſs a great part of <hi>Pruſia,</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> or grand <hi>Knez</hi> of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> a great part of <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> but as for <hi>Lithuania</hi> hee injoyeth it intirely, and hath reaſon to ſtile himſelf <hi>Grand Duke</hi> thereof, in regard it is a <hi>Dutchy</hi> of a very large extent. In the <hi>Sea</hi> the <hi>great</hi> Fiſhes devour the <hi>ſmaller,</hi> In the <hi>Heavens</hi> the appearance of the <hi>Sun</hi> Eclipſeth the <hi>Stars,</hi> and in the <hi>World</hi> the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> States ſwallow the <hi>weaker.</hi> Divers <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Lithuania</hi> were choſen by the <hi>Polonians</hi> to be their King, by which means the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> having reigned in <hi>Polonia,</hi> made <hi>Polonia</hi> reigne in <hi>Lithuania.</hi> For, from the time of <hi>Iagellon</hi> (as yet an <hi>Idolater</hi>) who, beeing turned <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> received in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> the Name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaüs,</hi> and married the Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> that <hi>Crown</hi> continued for many ſucceſſions in the <hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>Jagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi> untill the reign of <hi>Sigiſmond Auguſtus,</hi> in whoſe time happened the event which I now relate. All which by their birth rights, beeing <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> were elevated by <hi>Election</hi> to the <hi>Royall</hi> Throne of <hi>Polonia:</hi> And although they joyntly held thoſe two <hi>Sovereignties,</hi> yet they were diſtinct, and might bee ſeparated; Not that the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> omitted any indeavours to unite that <hi>Country</hi> to their <hi>State,</hi> and add that pretious <hi>Pearl</hi> to their <hi>Diadem;</hi> but the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> powerfully oppoſed them. And this was their <hi>Reaſon.</hi> There is no <hi>Nation</hi> nor <hi>Province</hi> ſo petty, but the People would bee glad to have a <hi>Prince</hi> of their own <hi>Land,</hi> though in this they know not what they ask. For, beeing received for a <hi>Maxime</hi> by the ſageſt <hi>Politicians, that little</hi> Principalities <hi>are great</hi> Tyrannies, <hi>and that</hi> a Soveraignty <hi>is the more juſt the greater it is,</hi> Who ſee's not that the pettieſt <hi>Princes,</hi> ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to imitate great <hi>Monarchs</hi> in their Pompous Trains and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, to maintain that ſtate are inforced to oppreſs their Subjects
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51476:137"/> with extraordinary impoſitions? Nevertheleſs the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> ſick of this <hi>popular</hi> error, deſiring alwayes a particular <hi>Duke,</hi> would never conſent to an union with the <hi>Polonians.</hi> Inſomuch that during all the forementioned ſucceſſions, very few years paſſed without ſome inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and revolting in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> to keep in breath the valour of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentry. And at the ſame time <hi>Liante</hi> took this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to periſh in the <hi>Wars,</hi> the <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Troc</hi> and <hi>Minſca,</hi> beeing returned mal-content from the <hi>Court,</hi> made a League offenſive and defenſive againſt the <hi>Polonians,</hi> and hooked into their <hi>Confederacy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of <hi>Kiovia</hi> and <hi>Polocia,</hi> divers <hi>Castellains</hi> of other <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates;</hi> in a word, the riſing was in a manner univerſall through all <hi>Lithuania.</hi>

Hee troubled not his thoughts to penetrate into the depth of the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> it ſuffiſed him, that hee had met with an employment wherein, by the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>valor,</hi> he might make appear the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>Courage.</hi>

               <p>The revolted <hi>Lithuanians</hi> not daring to incounter the <hi>Royall</hi> Army in the Field, ſheltred themſelves under the bulwarks of the ſtrongeſt <hi>Holds</hi> then in their poſſeſſion.

               <p>
                  <hi>Liante,</hi> who till then had lived in exceeding reſtraint, ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in full liberty of his deſires, was eaſily induced to the <hi>naturall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination hee had to <hi>Love. Olavius,</hi> among divers other Children, had two Daughters, whoſe Beauty deſerved obſervation: But the <hi>younger</hi> had a great advantage of <hi>Nature</hi> above her <hi>Elder</hi> Siſter, who was inferiour to her in all things but her age, wherein ſhee ſurpaſſed her by many years. The one was <hi>full-ripe,</hi> and in a condition that ſeemed viſibly to demand an <hi>Husband.</hi> The other was a <hi>Bud</hi> not quite blown, yet diſcovered ſomething that promiſed in her <hi>ſeaſon</hi> all the excellences of a perfect <hi>Roſe,</hi> but as yet ſo green, that her yeares might have diſpenſed the haſtieſt of her <hi>Sex</hi> to render her ſelfe under <hi>Hymen's</hi> pleaſing <hi>yoak;</hi> her <hi>humour</hi> was childiſhly vain, and more apt to give then receive <hi>Paſſion,</hi> her <hi>Judgement</hi> beeing yet inſuſceptible of any.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Liante's</hi> Fortune to be <hi>caught</hi> with this <hi>bait;</hi> betwixt ſeeing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51476:139"/> her and beeing taken, there was no great intervall. His <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> which hee hoped to recover by <hi>Olavius</hi> means gave him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence enough to aſpire to that <hi>alliance,</hi> and the merit of the <hi>Object</hi> contein'd captive but too many attractions to his deſire. Nevertheleſs hee hid his <hi>Fire</hi> under the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> expecting a fit time and opportunity to diſcloſe his intentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clemencia</hi> Siſter to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> poſſeſſed no ſuch charms, as could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to much <hi>Conſtancy;</hi> her <hi>fidelity</hi> onely having moved his Heart to a reciprocall <hi>amity:</hi> but in regard the <hi>Deſpair</hi> of poſſeſſing her, by reaſon of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> cruelty, and the <hi>Prince Caſſin's</hi> reſearch, forced him to relinquiſh that <hi>deſire;</hi> hee thought more of beeing revenged of that ſavage <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia,</hi> than of ſeeking her <hi>alliance,</hi> beeing the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incited thereunto by <hi>Deſpight,</hi> ſeeing his Siſter <hi>Modeſtina</hi> upon the point of beeing repudiated by <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> Upon theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee ſuffered the inclinations of his <hi>Minde</hi> to bend under the <hi>yoak</hi> of this new <hi>Captivity,</hi> ſuppreſſing however his <hi>flames</hi> within his <hi>breſt,</hi> allowing nothing to outward appearances, but what <hi>Modeſtie</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> might permit.</p>
               <p>Whileſt hee was contriving projects for the conqueſt of this <hi>Rachel, Olavius</hi> ſtudied how to ingage him in his alliance, by giving him the <hi>Leah:</hi> It beeing the cuſtome in theſe dayes, as well as in <hi>Laban's</hi> time, to marry the <hi>Elder</hi> Daughters before the <hi>yonger,</hi> Age, Reaſon and Decency requiring no leſs. <hi>Olavius</hi> having formerly been familiarly acquainted with <hi>Liante's</hi> Father, and knowing to how great an eſtate hee was <hi>heir</hi> (though <hi>Mieſlas</hi> unjuſtly deteined it from him) thought it no ſmall advantage to have him for a <hi>Son-in law</hi> (notwithſtanding his <hi>diſgrace</hi>) which hee could not have hoped for, if <hi>Fortune</hi> had been more kinde to him. Therefore to make him fall into his Nets, hee received him, as yet all wet with his <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> into his houſe, cheriſhed him as his <hi>Son,</hi> and rendered him all the indeering Offices, that could bee expected from a tender <hi>Father.</hi> His <hi>Table, Horſes, Attendants,</hi> and his <hi>Purſe,</hi> hee might command with as much freedom as himſelf: So that <hi>Liante</hi> feeling his generous heart o're-charged with ſo many Obligations, meditated nothing more then <hi>Olavius</hi> ſervice, and how beſt to comply with his diſpoſition, that hee might ſee hee had not ſowed his <hi>favours</hi> on an ingratefull <hi>Soil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Minſce</hi> had a <hi>Son,</hi> whoſe tender <hi>youth</hi> might have excuſed him from the uſe of <hi>Arms,</hi> had not his high <hi>Courage</hi> invited him to <hi>Martiall</hi> exerciſes for the defence of his <hi>Father's</hi> Fortune, then
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51476:139"/> ingaged in the <hi>Party</hi> of the <hi>Revolters.</hi> Him <hi>Olavius</hi> commanded to render ſo many, and ſuch reſpectfull devoirs to <hi>Liante,</hi> that at length thoſe <hi>Courteſies</hi> (which would have won the moſt untractable of <hi>Spirits</hi>) abſolutely charmed our gallant <hi>ſtranger's</hi> noble <hi>Heart,</hi> and laid the foundation of an inviolable <hi>friendſhip</hi> betwixt them.</p>
               <p>Already the deſire of dying was half quench't in <hi>Liante's</hi> Minde, and the <hi>Ambition</hi> of living to eſtabliſh his <hi>Fortune,</hi> and ſerve <hi>Amiclea</hi> (ſo was <hi>Olavius</hi> yonger Daughter named) wholly poſſeſſed his thoughts. And through the dore of this <hi>Love</hi> entred another ray of <hi>Glory,</hi> tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his aſpiring <hi>Heart,</hi> which inflamed him with a deſire of conquering that <hi>Michol</hi> by the death of many of her enemies.</p>
               <p>Whileſt hee conſumed in this ambitious impatience to ſignalize his valour by ſome honorable Combat, <hi>Oloria, Olavius</hi> eldeſt Daughter, ſuffered a no leſs torment, but of a contrary quality: For her Eyes having fed too greedily their ſight with the delicacies of <hi>Liante's</hi> Countenance, that ſweet <hi>Idea</hi> ſlipt into her <hi>Soul,</hi> and there ingraved it ſelf with ſo deep an inciſion, that it was beyond her power to efface it. Beſides this inclination (which ſhee diſſembled as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſhee could by the <hi>priviledge</hi> and innate <hi>Modesty</hi> of her <hi>Sex</hi>) when ſhee had an inkling from her <hi>Mother,</hi> to whom <hi>Olavius</hi> had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his deſigne, that they intended to marry her to <hi>Liante,</hi> you may imagine with what <hi>joy</hi> her <hi>Heart</hi> was dilated.</p>
               <p>Upon this aſſurance ſhee let her <hi>thoughts</hi> take <hi>Wing,</hi> and reſtreined her <hi>deſires</hi> with the leſs caution, becauſe the <hi>end</hi> of her pretenſions was honourable and lawfull; and paſſing ſomewhat beyond thoſe Limits of <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> which a fervent <hi>Love</hi> is eaſily perſwaded to exceed, ſhee prevented his <hi>Courting</hi> of Her with extraordinary <hi>careſſes,</hi> which made his <hi>Heart</hi> recoile as faſt as ſhee advanced; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the generall cuſtome among Men, who never eagerly purſue any, but ſuch as flie them, and contemn thoſe that meet or follow them: And it is likewiſe the Order of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> that <hi>Ladies</hi> ſhould make themſelves bee ſerved and obſerved, untill of <hi>Soveraigns</hi> Marriage tendereth them <hi>Subjects:</hi> Thoſe that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have found the direct means to make themſelves the <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>laughing-ſtock</hi> of all that ſee and know them. But to what extremities doth not that <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which blind's the diſcreeteſt Eyes, reduce the firmeſt and moſt reſolute <hi>Souls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante,</hi> who acknowledged himſelf highly obliged to her <hi>Father,</hi> for his favourable treatment, and her <hi>Brother</hi> for his Courteous
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51476:140"/> reſpects, could hardly conſtrein his <hi>humour</hi> from letting her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe affected attractions, and too fond indearments were not pleaſing to him. Shee uſed all the Plots her <hi>Paſſion</hi> could invent, to accoſt him, but hee ſhunned her incounter by ſuch ſtudied evaſions, <hi>that</hi> they ſeemed rather to proceed from the caſualty of occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than any ſubtilty of his. This caſt the poor <hi>Oloria</hi> into perplexities beyond expreſſion, and inflamed her deſire to exceſſes unimaginable. And as if <hi>Liante</hi> had premeditated to conſume that paſſionate admirer of his perfections, the more ſhee importuned him with her unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>kindneſſes,</hi> the more hee addreſſed his <hi>Courtſhips</hi> to <hi>Amiclea,</hi> whom though hee feined to love onely for divertiſement, her <hi>Image</hi> was imprinted in the <hi>Center</hi> of his <hi>Heart.</hi> Which poſſeſſed <hi>Oloria</hi> with ſo devouring an <hi>Envy,</hi> that it deprived her Soul of all ſort of contentment and repoſe; I might ſtyle that <hi>torment</hi> of her's <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> if ſhee had ever communicated her affection to <hi>Liante,</hi> and hee given her any hope of reciprocating her flames; but no ſuch correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence having paſt between them, me-think's the name of <hi>Envy</hi> doth better repreſent her pain, underſtanding but too well, by the faithfull report of her Looking-glaſs, the advantages <hi>Nature</hi> had beſtowed on her <hi>Siſter</hi> above <hi>her;</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Amiclea</hi> preferr'd before her by him whoſe ſenſes ſhee deſired to captivate, and render ſuſceptible of her reſentments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> permitted not <hi>Olavius</hi> to break the Ice, and offer his Daughter to <hi>Liante,</hi> leſt that might give him occaſion to think that hee intended to ſell his favours to him, and preſs him with a bond which ought to tie none, but thoſe that are willing. <hi>Polemander</hi> (ſo was <hi>Olavius</hi> Son named) who would have been very glad to have had him for a <hi>Brother-in-law,</hi> that already profeſſed to bee his <hi>friend,</hi> deſired nothing ſo eagerly as to ſee <hi>Liante's</hi> Eyes turned towards his Siſter <hi>Oloria;</hi> But what Gins and Netts ſoever the Fowlers uſe, the Birds doe not alwayes light where they could wiſh. Thus <hi>Liante</hi> was eſteemed by her whom hee neglected, and adored her who had not yet <hi>Judgement</hi> to diſcerne his <hi>Deſert,</hi> nor recompence his <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this condition to divert the cares, which diſturbed his thoughts, by the <hi>importunity</hi> of the one, and the <hi>inſenſibility</hi> of the other, there beeing every day occaſion of <hi>action,</hi> hee watcht for ſome opportunity of rendering himſelf remarkeable by his <hi>valour.</hi> Few dayes paſſed without ſome deſperate <hi>Sallies, Skermiſhes, Aſſaults,</hi> or <hi>Surpriſalls,</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:51476:140"/> wherein <hi>Liante</hi> was continually one of the forwardeſt to charge, ad laſt in the retreat: And divers ſingle Combats were fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt particular <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> wherein the beſieged were ſometimes Conquerours, ſometimes conquered, according to the chance of Armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> intended to challenge <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and take an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the unworthy outrages which hee had received from his <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme;</hi> but <hi>Olavius</hi> (who tendered his preſervation as his own <hi>Son's</hi>) adviſed him firſt to make his triall upon ſome other, leſt undertaking a Combat with too much unadviſedneſs hee ſhould not come off with his <hi>Honour.</hi> At length having obtained leave (not without much perſwaſion) of the chief <hi>Commanders,</hi> hee put on a ſuit of black <hi>Armour</hi> imbelliſhed in the extremities of the Joints with fillets of <hi>Gold;</hi> and having choſen in the <hi>Palatine's</hi> ſtable an Horſe of the ſame colour, capariſon'd with black <hi>Velvet</hi> inriched with a golden <hi>Purle,</hi> and all his furniture of the like trimming, hee ſent a Trumpeter forth to invite any <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the <hi>Royall</hi> Army to break a <hi>Lance,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheath his <hi>Cimeterre,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Lady</hi> whom hee chiefly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
               <p>Upon this invitation appeared in the Field, mounted on a ſtately <hi>Steed,</hi> more white than the newly fallen Snow, a <hi>Knight</hi> of an admirable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, covered from the Head to the Knees with an <hi>Armour</hi> of refined <hi>Silver,</hi> ſo curiouſly wrought, that the value of the <hi>Mettle,</hi> though pure and precious, was ſurmounted by the rarity of the <hi>Workmanſhip.</hi> The harneſs of the Horſe was ſet all over with plates of burniſht <hi>Silver,</hi> which made a ſhew like ſo many ſeverall Looking glaſſes, according to the motion of the <hi>Palfrey,</hi> no leſs couragious than full of gracefull pride; a Milk-white <hi>Plume</hi> ſhadowed the <hi>Torſe</hi> of his glittering <hi>Helmet,</hi> and floted in agreeable waves upon his ſhoulders: His <hi>Port</hi> was full of ſprightlie <hi>Activity,</hi> in his <hi>Countenance</hi> hee ſeemed another <hi>Mars;</hi> and his <hi>Carriage</hi> made appear leſs <hi>fierceneſs</hi> then <hi>Courage. Liante</hi> could not have pickt out a more worthy <hi>Adverſary</hi> to content his <hi>Vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce were they come within ſight of each other, but the <hi>Trumpets</hi> on both ſides ſounded; and the <hi>Champions,</hi> having taken ſpace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a full <hi>Career,</hi> incountred with ſuch <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,</hi> that ſitting as immoveable as <hi>Mountaines,</hi> their <hi>Lances</hi> (beeing broken to the very <hi>Handles</hi>) ſent their <hi>ſplinters</hi> into the <hi>Airy</hi> Region; then caſting away their <hi>Truncheons,</hi> they ended their <hi>cours,</hi> in ſo exact
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51476:141"/> and handſome a manner, that it ſeemed rather a <hi>Turnament</hi> than a <hi>Combat:</hi> And to conclude with their <hi>Swords</hi> what they had begun with their <hi>Lances,</hi> they both drew and rejoined upon their <hi>Manege;</hi> but having both <hi>Armour</hi> of proof, they hack't a long time before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them received any wound. At length the white <hi>Knight</hi> thinking to cut <hi>Liante</hi> over the <hi>Beaver</hi> with a back-blow, his Horſe curvetting received it upon his Head, the pain whereof made him reare on end, beating the <hi>Air</hi> with his Fore-feet ready to caſt his <hi>Rider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which troubled <hi>Liante</hi> moſt, was to feele the reins in his hand and the bit out of his Horſe's mouth; for, his <hi>Adverſarie's</hi> Sword having cut the head-ſtall, the Bridle fell preſently from him. The fiery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited Beaſt, which could neither bee tamed nor guided by him that back't him, inraged with the ſmart of his wound, running full gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop croſs the field, carried <hi>Liante</hi> towards the beſieger's <hi>Trenches.</hi> Hee, who would rather have embraced <hi>Death</hi> from a generous <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie's</hi> hands than fall into <hi>Mieſlas</hi> power, ſeeing the unrulineſs of his Horſe, leap't nimbly out of his Saddle, and returned on Foot to preſent himſelf to the Silver <hi>Knight,</hi> who purſued him full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeed.</p>
               <p>But when his <hi>Adverſary</hi> was come within hearing, a clear voyce out of the Silver <hi>Helmet</hi> pierced his Ears, ſaying, <hi>Knight, I will not make uſe of this advantage which</hi> Fortune <hi>hath given mee, true valour is not to bee tried upon ſuch unequall tearms: Liante</hi> (who gave himſelf for <hi>Dead,</hi> imagining that his <hi>Enemy</hi> came with ſuch fury to make his Horſe dance upon his belly) received a new <hi>Life,</hi> when hee heard the beloved voyce of that perſon whom hee eſteemed above all Creatures breathing. So the white <hi>Knight</hi> had ſcarce ſet foot to ground, but hee in the black <hi>Armour</hi> bowing his <hi>Knee,</hi> and lifting up his <hi>Beaver,</hi> cryed alowd; <hi>Brother, as it never was my intention to</hi> offend <hi>you, ſo I will not</hi> defend <hi>my ſelf againſt you; although I ſhould give you my</hi> Life, <hi>I ſhould not conceive that I had ſatisfied the leaſt of thoſe</hi> Devoirs <hi>which I owe you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this you may know it was <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who beeing no leſs deſirous of <hi>Glory,</hi> than <hi>Liante</hi> of putting himſelf in credit, had undertaken this <hi>Combat</hi> in that white <hi>Armour;</hi> and upon <hi>Liante's</hi> words hee preſently replied, <hi>My dear</hi> Brother, <hi>it is you that have overcome mee; yet alas! you are ignorant of your victory. But this is no place for us to diſpute of Courteſies, leſt wee ſhould bee ſuſpected of ſome private</hi> intelligence <hi>and</hi> treaſon. <hi>Riſe quickly, and let us give notice to our ſeverall</hi> Parties, <hi>that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51476:141"/> after knowing each other, our long education together having rendered us</hi> Brothers <hi>by</hi> Alliance, <hi>wee would not renew the</hi> tragicall <hi>spectacle of</hi> Eteocles <hi>and</hi> Polinices, <hi>nor change into</hi> Horrour <hi>the</hi> Admiration <hi>which wee deſired to breed in the beholders of our</hi> Courages. <hi>Wee may confer ſecretly in the</hi> Night, <hi>or interchangeably make known our intentions by</hi> Letters, <hi>and other means which ſubtility will ſuggeſt to our inventions, for the advancement of his</hi> Majeſtie's <hi>intereſt: And to the end wee may have no advantage of each other, return you to the</hi> City <hi>upon my</hi> Horſe, <hi>which I give you, I beeing ſure to have</hi> your's <hi>reſtored mee, in regard hee hath taken his courſe towards the</hi> Quarters <hi>where I have a</hi> Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> took <hi>Iphigenes</hi> advice; ſo the two <hi>friends</hi> parted to the great aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Enemies,</hi> who obſerved theſe paſſages at a diſtance. But when they underſtood that the <hi>Combat,</hi> which they had ſo gloriouſly begun, before they knew each other, was terminated, after their diſcovery, by the force of their antient friendſhip, which ſnatcht their Arms out of their hands, there was not one but rather commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them for that generous affection, than condemned them for want of courage, deploring the uncivill condition of civill Wars, which conſtrein ſometimes, in like Occurrences, friends to murther Friends, and Fathers to plunge their Weapons in their own Blood.</p>
               <p>Onely <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> (whoſe <hi>Rigour</hi> could not bee ſatisfied with leſs than the <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>Liante's</hi> Honour and Life) gave out in all Companies that hee had baſely begg'd his Life of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> againſt whom (ſuch is the blindneſs of <hi>Fury</hi>) hee murmured and expreſſed much diſpleaſure, that hee had not made uſe of his advantage to ranke <hi>Liante</hi> among the number of the Dead. And in regard the motion of that ſordide intereſt, which made him ſo thirſt after <hi>Liante's</hi> Blood, could not bee publiſhed without his own diſparagement, hee covered it with the <hi>Cloak</hi> of the <hi>Publick</hi> Cauſe, indeavouring to make that poor <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> revolt more odious than the <hi>Lithuanian's,</hi> hee beeing a Native of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and owing all his <hi>Fortune</hi> to the <hi>King's</hi> munificence: But the barbarous <hi>Sarmatian</hi> was not ſo ready to declare the occaſion hee gave his <hi>Ward</hi> to take that deſperate courſe, and in thoſe commotions to ſecure himſelf among the <hi>Rebells.</hi> Nay, his Brutality tranſported him ſo far, that hee ſtuck not to taxe his own <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>intelligence</hi> with the <hi>Enemy,</hi> becauſe hee had left <hi>Liante</hi> living, when hee might have kill'd him, or at leaſt made him Priſoner, which hee rather deſired: Not contented to reſemble <hi>Hogs-heads,</hi> which (beeing filled with new
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51476:142"/> 
                  <hi>Wine</hi>) bedawb themſelves with their own froth, hee thought that during this revolt of <hi>Liante's,</hi> was the onely Harveſt-ſeaſon for him to reap his Eſtate, by vertue of the <hi>King's</hi> Letters of confiſcation: Which hee obteined at his firſt requeſt, His <hi>Majeſtie</hi> beeing willing to oblige Him, whom hee eſteemed one of the beſt <hi>Politicians</hi> in his <hi>Army;</hi> and beſides to terrifie, by this example, any other <hi>Polonians</hi> from aſſiſting the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> in their <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Grace made <hi>Mieſlas</hi> triumph, and boaſt <hi>that</hi> hee had done <hi>Liante</hi> more harm with a ſheet of <hi>Paper,</hi> than his <hi>Son</hi> with his <hi>Sword.</hi> Fame with her airy trump at length conveyed theſe <hi>Bravadoes</hi> to <hi>Liante's</hi> Ears, which kindled a rage in his couragious breſt as unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as inſupportable; Inſomuch that returning to his former <hi>Deſpair,</hi> hee perſwaded himſelf (conſidering <hi>Mieſlas</hi> as his ſcourge) that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> obliged him to take away that Wolviſh <hi>Gardian's</hi> Life, or loſe his own. In this reſolution hee ſent him a <hi>Challenge</hi> to fight with him on Horſe-back in the view of both <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Army.</hi> At firſt <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ſcoffed at his Childiſh indiſcretion (as hee tearmed it) ſlighting him as much as the grand <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> did <hi>Citherea's</hi> little <hi>Son.</hi> But at length feeling his <hi>reputation</hi> prick'd, and his <hi>Choller</hi> incenſ'd by ſome notorious <hi>reproaches</hi> and <hi>braving Language</hi> in the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Defiance</hi> (whereof <hi>Liante</hi> had diſperſed diverſe Copies through the <hi>Camp</hi>) hee reſolved to diſpoſe himſelf to chaſtiſe that peremptory <hi>Boy</hi> publickly, as a <hi>Pedagogue</hi> would correct his <hi>Scholler:</hi> Theſe tearms <hi>Paſſion</hi> made him utter againſt his youthfull adverſary.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Challenge,</hi> beeing ſo divulged, could not bee unknown to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who would not bee diſwaded from beeing a <hi>Second;</hi> as well to purge himſelf of that ſtain wherewith his <hi>Father</hi> had indevoured to blemiſh his fidelity to the <hi>King,</hi> as to preſerve the Life of him that gave him <hi>his,</hi> (in caſe <hi>Liante</hi> ſhould gain the advantage) or <hi>Liante's,</hi> on whom his own Life depended, in caſe <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ſhould have the better, which was moſt probable. I will not ſtand to particularize the ſeverall equipages of theſe <hi>Combatants,</hi> there beeing this difference betwixt <hi>Turnaments</hi> and <hi>Duells,</hi> that in the former every one ſtudie's what is moſt magnificent and pompous, not what moſt ſerviceable; in the later the richneſs or curioſity of the <hi>Armour</hi> is not ſo much conſidered, as the excellency of the <hi>temper.</hi> However they were not negligent to ſhew themſelves in good order, and upon the beſt Horſes they could purchaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> having ſent back <hi>Liante's</hi> black Horſe, obliged him by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51476:142"/> that action to return him his, leſt that exchange might breed any <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition</hi> of <hi>intelligence:</hi> yet they took others for this ſecond incounter, that breathed <hi>Fire</hi> out of their <hi>Mouths,</hi> &amp; threatned <hi>Death</hi> with their <hi>Looks. Mieſlas</hi> appeared in <hi>guilded Armour,</hi> upon a <hi>pide</hi> Horſe of a ſize bigger then ordinary: <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was mounted upon a <hi>Sorrell,</hi> well maneged and ready, armed as before, but with a coat, after the <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> faſhion, over his <hi>Armour,</hi> all imbrodered with Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> march'd proudly out of the <hi>City</hi> upon a ſtately <hi>Bay</hi> horſe, trapped with black, in the ſame <hi>Armour</hi> hee wore in the former Duell, but with ſome different trimming: His <hi>Second,</hi> who was the young <hi>Polemander,</hi> ſeemed rather dreſſ'd than arm'd, Inexperience making him go to this ſhock as to a Wedding. His <hi>Armour</hi> was <hi>Graſ-green,</hi> artificially ſet out with ſcales of burniſht <hi>Silver;</hi> a delicate <hi>Plume</hi> of white and green, curiouſly mixt, o're ſhadowed all his <hi>Casket;</hi> his <hi>Horſe</hi> of a <hi>Dapple-gray</hi> colour, (whoſe Make and Manegement was fitter for a Feſtivall ſhew before <hi>Ladies</hi> than exploits of Warre) was harneſſ'd with a <hi>Capariſon</hi> of green <hi>velvet,</hi> inriched with a Silver <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodery;</hi> his <hi>Deportment</hi> ſpake him rather a ſpruce <hi>Courtier</hi> than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Souldier:</hi> In ſumme, he was a fit <hi>Subject</hi> to honour the triumph of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> victory. The glory of making his eſſay of Arms againſt the <hi>King's</hi> Favorite, &amp; a <hi>Palatine</hi> of ſo eminent eſteem in <hi>Polonia,</hi> height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his <hi>courage;</hi> and his <hi>vanity</hi> promiſed him a ſucceſs that ſhould make him touch the <hi>Firmament</hi> with his <hi>Crown.</hi> But <hi>Heaven</hi> which diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the events otherwiſe than <hi>Men</hi> propoſe them to their fancies, made this <hi>Gallant</hi> a prey to him whom hee thought to devour; and <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who was <hi>Courteſie</hi> it ſelf, became to him like the <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>Samſon's</hi> emblem: For, inſtead of ſwallowing him, hee gave him <hi>Life,</hi> and in the Effects of this <hi>Valour</hi> hee made him feel the proofs of his <hi>Civility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, aſſoon as they were come into the <hi>Field,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> had aſſigned the ground, every one reſolved to do his beſt, except <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who carried himſelf negligently in that Action, as if hee diſdained to meaſure his <hi>Sword</hi> with a <hi>Novice,</hi> or had been to play at cuffs with a <hi>Boy.</hi> At length having taken the ſpace that was convenient for their <hi>Horſe's</hi> full <hi>Career,</hi> they charged each other with ſuch impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that the banks of <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> returned by frighted <hi>Eccho's</hi> the ſound of their <hi>Palfrey's</hi> thundering Feet, and his Waters haſted away for fear. <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> whoſe dexterity on Horſe back was beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, having hit <hi>Polemander</hi> in the right place to make him quit
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51476:143"/> his Saddle, carried him ſo furiouſly from his <hi>Horſe</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> that with the force of the fall hee ſeemed to have digg'd his own <hi>Sepulcher</hi> in the Sand. The weight of his <hi>Arms,</hi> the violence of the <hi>Shock,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the tender <hi>Age</hi> of that young <hi>Aſtianax,</hi> caſt him into a <hi>Trance,</hi> which depriving him of the ability to riſe or move, made him appear, as if his <hi>Soul,</hi> not daring to withſtand ſo invincible an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, had left his <hi>Carcaſs</hi> as a <hi>trophy</hi> to the Victor's <hi>glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſeeing him in no fighting condition, turn'd his <hi>Eyes</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Heart</hi> was already flown; But <hi>Heavens!</hi> what ſaw hee? his <hi>Father</hi> in the greateſt danger that could befall an <hi>Enemy;</hi> For, as hee gave his Horſe the half-turn, to ſet him in his <hi>Career,</hi> the right ſtirrop brake, which diſcompoſed his Port, and rendred him incapable of executing what his <hi>Vanity</hi> made him believe unqueſtionable: For, the heavineſs of his <hi>Armour</hi> weighing him down in the <hi>Saddle,</hi> that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience hindered him from ordering his <hi>Lance,</hi> which glanced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect under <hi>Liante's</hi> Arme, who having dexterouſly directed <hi>his,</hi> where the point found entrance, the thruſt was ſo violent, that had not <hi>Mieſlas</hi> been well fixed in his ſeat, hee had doubtleſs held <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> company: However it bare his <hi>Body</hi> ſo far backwards, that his <hi>Creſt</hi> almoſt kiſt the <hi>Crupper,</hi> and the <hi>Lance</hi> flying in pieces, a ſplinter entered into his <hi>Horſe's</hi> ſhoulder, the pain whereof diſabling him for ſuch an incounter, put his <hi>Rider</hi> beyond his ſchoole-play, and in no ſmall apprehenſion. <hi>Liante</hi> without loſing time, having caſt away the <hi>truncheon</hi> that remained in his hand, drew his <hi>Sable,</hi> and his <hi>Horſe</hi> beeing ſwift of foot and ready at hand, hee preſently gained the <hi>Crupper</hi> of his no leſs arrogant than inhumane <hi>Enemy;</hi> and began to deal blowes ſo thick upon him, that you would have thought you had heard all the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> beating upon one Anvill. Who ever ſaw a furious <hi>Bull</hi> tormented with the ſtinging of a <hi>Gad flie;</hi> or a great wild <hi>Boare</hi> lugged by the Ears by a young <hi>Maſtiffe,</hi> may the better fancy that luſty <hi>Sarmatian</hi> aſſaulted by the generous <hi>Liante.</hi> At length the little <hi>ſtone</hi> caſt down the great <hi>Coloſſus;</hi> it happened thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ſeeing his <hi>Horſe</hi> uſeleſs, and one Leg hanging without a ſtirrop, thought to alight, judging that hee might better defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on Foot, than in that incommodious poſture; but having his <hi>Sword</hi> in his hand, and beeing incumbred with his <hi>Armour,</hi> his other foot remain'd ingaged in the ſtirrop; The <hi>Horſe</hi> who had not yet loſt all his fury, perceiving this diſorder, began to kick and drag <hi>Mieſlas</hi> after him ſome ſteps, which ſo cruſhed and bruiſed him, that hee thought
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51476:143"/> hee had been at the laſt period of his Life. Then was it in the brave <hi>Liante's</hi> power to take a full revenge of all his barbarous dealings, by making his <hi>Horſe</hi> trample his unworthy <hi>Soul</hi> out of his conquered <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> But <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſeeing the danger of him from whom hee had his <hi>Beeing,</hi> leaving his adverſary on the ground, ran preſently to <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> whoſe deplorable condition ſufficiently implored his ſuccour: At length hee ſtopt the <hi>fugitive</hi> Horſe, and leaping from his own, hee cut the ſtirrop that trailed his <hi>Father's</hi> Body, which was in little better caſe than <hi>Polemander's.</hi> Hee was already without motion, and queſtionleſs had taken his leave of the <hi>World,</hi> if the pious <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> opening his <hi>Head-piece,</hi> had not given him ſome <hi>Air;</hi> which hee no ſooner felt, but hee recovered <hi>Breath,</hi> not without voiding blood at the Noſe and Mouth in great abundance.</p>
               <p>After ſome paſſages of the triumphing <hi>Liante,</hi> the deſire of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Mieſlas</hi> drew theſe words from <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Mouth (which his high <hi>spirit</hi> would never have permitted his <hi>Tongue</hi> to utter, if his own perſon had been reduced to the greateſt of extremities) <hi>Liante, it is now in thy power to rid thy ſelf of both</hi> Father <hi>and</hi> Son <hi>at once, if thou permitteſt thy</hi> Vengeance <hi>to deſpiſe my</hi> Friendſhip: <hi>but know that</hi> Heaven <hi>never leaves</hi> Ingratitude <hi>unpuniſhed; content thy</hi> Ambition <hi>with the advantage the</hi> Chance <hi>of</hi> Arms <hi>hath now given thee, without abuſing by Inſolence thy</hi> Victory; <hi>and if thou art as good a</hi> Friend <hi>as a ſtout</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, <hi>go ſuccour him whom I have reduced to the ſame danger as thou haſt my</hi> Father. <hi>Brave Iphigenes,</hi> replyed Liante, <hi>thy</hi> Friendſhip, <hi>which ſhall never die in my</hi> Soul, <hi>ſhall alwayes have more</hi> power <hi>over mee than the</hi> Outrages <hi>of that Tyrant; It is pitty that a Son ſo full of Vertue ſhould proceed from a Father ſo worthy of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</hi> ADIEU, <hi>and know that thy</hi> Will <hi>is the</hi> Chain <hi>of my</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, hee paſſed as quick as a flaſh of Lightning, ſpurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Polemander,</hi> in whoſe pale Face <hi>Death</hi> had already plac'd her <hi>Enſignes.</hi> Having looſened his <hi>Helmet,</hi> hee ſaw his <hi>Eyes</hi> begin to open, as if hee came from the other <hi>World.</hi> But not to ſpend any longer time in this <hi>Relation,</hi> at length every one returned to his <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> the beſt he could, leaving the judgements of the Spectatours ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the ſtrangeneſs of this incounter; which gave ſcope enough for diſcourſe on both ſides. But let this ſuffice, that all acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hand of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon the <hi>Arrogance</hi> of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on <hi>Polemander,</hi> eſteemed the fortunate <hi>Valour</hi> of <hi>Liante,</hi> but

               </p>
               <p>To expreſs the <hi>rage</hi> that ſeized <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> when (come again to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) hee repreſented to his thoughts the Affront hee had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Face of the whole <hi>Army,</hi> were impoſſible; <hi>Eloquence</hi> want's tearms to relate the <hi>Exceſs</hi> of his <hi>Fury.</hi> Sometimes hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Heaven</hi> as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of his <hi>Diſaſter;</hi> Sometimes hee condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Servants</hi> for bringing him that <hi>Horſe;</hi> Sometimes hee was in the humour to dy, rather than ſurvive ſuch a diſgrace; Sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of acknowledging the <hi>courteſie</hi> hee had received from his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> hee ſeemed as if (like a <hi>Torrent</hi> or <hi>Thunder-bolt</hi>) hee would force through the Walls of the beſieged <hi>City</hi> to tear the <hi>heart</hi> out of <hi>Liante's Boſome.</hi> Hee that hath e're beheld a <hi>Bear,</hi> wounded with an <hi>Arrow</hi> ſticking in his <hi>Flank,</hi> beat himſelf againſt the <hi>Shaft,</hi> take it in his <hi>Teeth,</hi> and ſtriving turn it within his <hi>Entrails,</hi> hath ſeen an <hi>emblem</hi> of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> Paſſion, which bred ſuch torment in his <hi>mind,</hi> as cannot bee expreſs'd but by the Name of <hi>Despair.</hi> All bruiſed as hee lay in his Bed, beeing hardly able to move, hee ſtudied memorable <hi>revenges</hi> againſt him to whom hee owed his <hi>Life.</hi> But leaving him to foam out his <hi>Choler,</hi> let us ſee what <hi>Liante</hi> do's within the <hi>City,</hi> where there were not <hi>Laurells</hi> enough to make him <hi>Crowns,</hi> nor <hi>Praiſes</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant enough to extoll his <hi>Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The indiſpoſition of <hi>Polemander,</hi> ſomewhat diſturbed the Inhabitants rejoicing; but the <hi>publick Good</hi> always overbalancing the diſaſter of any <hi>particular</hi> perſon, it did not diminiſh the applauſes of his <hi>Gallantry;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, hee having no other harm than what hee received by his fall, the care of his <hi>Parents,</hi> his own <hi>youth</hi> and good <hi>conſtitution</hi> ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him to a condition that promiſed more <hi>Hope</hi> than <hi>Fear</hi> of his recovery.</p>
               <p>Mean time, whileſt the <hi>Brother's</hi> Body was healing, the <hi>Siſter's</hi> mind impaired; For, <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> which is a <hi>Love</hi> that's ſick, increaſed in <hi>Oloria's</hi> Heart proportionably as <hi>Liante</hi> rendered more evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of affection to <hi>Amiclea.</hi> And now his thoughts beeing ſwell'd with the glory of this <hi>Victory,</hi> what durſt not hee promiſe himſelf? as you may well imagine, his <hi>Minde</hi> beeing naturally <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> hee eaſily ſuffered himſelf to bee carried upon the <hi>Wings</hi> of the <hi>Wind,</hi> feeling a pleaſing murmure of <hi>popular</hi> praiſes buzzing in his Ears.

But hee continued his addreſſes with much fervency, and dayly increaſed his Indearments to <hi>Amiclea,</hi> who though yet young enough not to reſent the aſſaults of that <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which is ſo contagious, that few are exempted from it's infection, even of thoſe that moſt condemn it; yet ſhee was not compoſed of Ice, nor any inſenſible Materialls.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Hee that compared the <hi>Fire,</hi> which cauſeth <hi>Love,</hi> to <hi>Thunder,</hi> was not miſtaken in his <hi>Analogy:</hi> For, the effects of both are marvellous, the one bruiſe's and conſume's the <hi>Bones,</hi> without making the leaſt contuſion in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and preſerving the <hi>Scabbard,</hi> melt's the <hi>Blade:</hi> the other hath Subtilities and Inventions beyond the reach of thought to dazle the Eyes of the moſt circumſpect. Nothing is impoſſible to him that Love's: <hi>Iphigenes</hi> practiſed ſuch ſecret and facile Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with <hi>Liante,</hi> that if they had been both in the ſame <hi>Camp,</hi> they could not have had more convenience to communicate their thoughts. In <hi>Day</hi> time their Conference was by <hi>Letters,</hi> which, faſtened to Arrowes, they ſhot into certain places at prefixed houres; In the <hi>Night</hi> they found opportunity enough to Diſcourſe together, without apprehenſion of beeing over heard by any witneſſes. Once, after divers other particulars. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> regretting that Peaceable time, wherein they injoyed in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Plocens</hi> with more freedom each other's converſation, and wiſhing to ſee the like ſeaſon, that hee might in his own government impart his honours, and eſtate to his dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Of</hi> what Peace, and what pleaſure (<hi>replied Liante</hi>) do you ſpeak? <hi>For my particular I do not think that in all my Life I ever felt a greater diſturbance in my thoughts, than what glanced into my</hi> Breſt <hi>from the penetrating</hi> Eyes <hi>of</hi> Serife; <hi>For, thoſe extravagant illuſions ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed my</hi> Reaſon, <hi>that I thought I ſhould have loſt it in a</hi> Labyrinth <hi>of conceptions ſo confuſed, that I may call that diſaſter happy which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed mee out of that error. But now my Condition is quite altered; For, if during that</hi> Peace; <hi>I felt a</hi> War <hi>within my ſelf, in this</hi> War <hi>I have met with ſo great a</hi> Calm <hi>and ſo ſweet a</hi> Peace, <hi>that I hold nothing ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious as the double</hi> Priſon <hi>wherein I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Priſons are thoſe?</hi> anſwered Iphigenes. <hi>The firſt,</hi> ſaid Liante, <hi>is the incloſure of theſe Walls, but the ſecond, and moſt agreeable, is an</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:51476:146"/> Object <hi>whoſe</hi> Captive <hi>I am; but my</hi> thraldome <hi>is preferable to any</hi> Liberty. At this word a cold ſweat trickled along <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Face, and hardly could hee forbear in falling to a trance; yet recollecting his <hi>Spirits,</hi> hee preſt <hi>Liante</hi> to tell him, what <hi>Object</hi> that was to whom hee had ſo dedicated his ſervices.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Liante,</hi> as if hee had reſolved to diſcompoſe the frame of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> intellect, and abſolutely turn his <hi>Brain,</hi> began to make him a lively deſcription of <hi>Amiclea's</hi> beauties; which was leſs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his Ears, than the newes of approaching <hi>Death.</hi> But when hee added, <hi>that thoſe perfections beeing not yet come to</hi> Maturity, <hi>that green fruit was ſo tart, and crabbed that it rather ſet the teeth on edge, than gave any delight, and by reaſon of her tender years (which rendered her not onely inſuſceptible of</hi> Love's <hi>flames, but incapable of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his</hi> affection) that <hi>in the ſame place where his</hi> deſires <hi>had their Birth, his</hi> Hopes <hi>did finde their Funerall,</hi> Iphigenes recovered breath. And, as every thing hath two handles, and its counterpoiſe, when <hi>Liante</hi> added to the <hi>Paſſion</hi> hee indured for <hi>Amiclea,</hi> that which hee made poor <hi>Oloria</hi> ſuffer, our amorous <hi>Palatine</hi> was yet better ſatisfied; imagining that this Contradiction would hinder <hi>Liante</hi> from making any great progreſs in <hi>Amiclea's</hi> affection.</p>
               <p>But from this <hi>Feaver,</hi> hee fell into an hotter, the ſtorm beginning afreſh with more impetuoſity in his thoughts, when hee heard <hi>Liante</hi> proteſting, <hi>that the</hi> Jealouſie <hi>of the One ſerved as a ſpur to incite him to bee more eager in the</hi> reſearch <hi>of the Other, wherein hee believed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would not bee fruitleſs, in regard of the particular advice hee had of</hi> Olavius <hi>deſign to give him one of his</hi> Daughters; <hi>and that his laſt</hi> Victory <hi>had reduced him to that point, that hee was contented to grant him his own choice, hoping to make the confiſcation of his</hi> Eſtate <hi>bee revoaked by their treaty with the</hi> King <hi>for the appeaſing of thoſe</hi> tumults <hi>in</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania.</p>
               <p>See how <hi>Jealouſie</hi> tranſport's the beſt compoſed Braines. <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> who had all his Life-time ſhewed ſo much Diſcretion, and Reſervedneſs in his Actions, ſuffering himſelf to bee carried away with the ſtream of <hi>Fury,</hi> broke forth in theſe Words: Ah! Traytor, <hi>and the moſt defiled with infidelity of any the World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce's? Is this the promiſe ſo oft repeated in the ſolitudes of my</hi> Palatinate, <hi>when thou ſworest (but with</hi> Oaths <hi>which flew away with the</hi> Winds) <hi>never to love any but mee, and never to ſuffer thy</hi> Soul <hi>to entertain any other</hi> Flame? <hi>Is it thus thou wilt now renounce the too too eaſie, too
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51476:147"/> too credulous</hi> Serife? <hi>That</hi> Serife, <hi>who hath no Eyes but to contemplate thee, and who love's her</hi> Heart <hi>onely becauſe of thy</hi> Image <hi>which is ſo lively imprinted in it. That</hi> Serife, <hi>who hath been more tender of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thee, than her own Life, who would have raiſed thee to greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Riches than thou can'ſt hope for in any other place. And foole, as ſhee was, ſhee turned all thy Diſcourſes to her own advantage, and fed her</hi> vanity <hi>with the praiſes wherewith thou extolled'st her perfections, with as much treachery as flattery; And after this ſhould ſhee eſteem the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of any</hi> Man? <hi>May the</hi> Heavens <hi>afflict her with ſome new torment, (if there bee any greater than that which thy diſloyalty make's her ſuffer) if ever ſhee put's confidence in ſuch faithleſs</hi> Souls. <hi>Thou ſhould'ſt have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her upon her</hi> Father's <hi>body, rather than have reſerved her to hear ſuch language as is leſs ſupportable than</hi> Death.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Liante</hi> was ſurpriſed at this Speech, let him judge that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked the conduct of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> hitherto. Hee thought hee dream'd, or that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> raved. For, to what purpoſe ſhould hee bring again upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> the ſweet illuſions of the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Plocens,</hi> when <hi>Almeria</hi> was beloved by <hi>Iphis,</hi> or when <hi>Calliante</hi> acted the paſſionate <hi>Lover</hi> of <hi>Serife?</hi> At length, <hi>Brother</hi> (ſaid hee) <q>What is in your <hi>mind?</hi> I think the <hi>Charms</hi> of that inchanted <hi>Foreſt</hi> poſſeſs you yet, or (which is more likely) you ſleep, as <hi>Lions</hi> doe, with your <hi>Eyes</hi> open.

Your <hi>Father,</hi> my <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> hath rendered mee ſo odious in the <hi>King's</hi> ſight, that I have more <hi>reaſon</hi> to <hi>fear</hi> his <hi>indignation,</hi> than <hi>hope</hi> for any <hi>favour</hi> in <hi>Polonia;</hi> which make's mee reſolve either to loſe my ſelf in the overthrow of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> or if it raiſe it ſelf again out
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51476:147"/> of it's ruines, thereby to repair thoſe of my <hi>Fortune.</hi> Would to <hi>God</hi> I might bee permitted to ſpend my dayes with you; For, if I enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that happineſs, all my ambitions might expire, knowing with the <hi>power</hi> you have, that I could expect no leſs than great effects of your exceeding <hi>Love.</hi> But did not you take notice that your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant raving made you ſpeak like a <hi>Woman,</hi> as if that <hi>Serife</hi> to whom I vowed my <hi>Affections,</hi> were any other than <hi>your ſelf?</hi> So, you might make mee believe that I am <hi>Almeria.</hi> See how farre our paſt <hi>follies</hi> tranſport us, agreeable <hi>follies</hi> however, ſince they pleaſe you; but very bitter to mee, whom they had almoſt bereaved of <hi>ſenſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Hereunto <hi>Iphigenes</hi> could make no reply, but to end all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, hee wiſhed, that one of them two were a <hi>Woman.

               </p>
               <p>At their review <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſeeming to have ſeriouſly deliberated upon what <hi>Liante</hi> had propoſed at their laſt meeting, ſaid, <hi>that hee diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not his</hi> re-ſearch <hi>to Amiclea, conſidering that hee hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter into the poſſeſſion of his</hi> Eſtate <hi>by that</hi> alliance; <hi>But if hee would
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51476:148"/> contribute his</hi> induſtry <hi>to pacifie thoſe</hi> Commotions <hi>of</hi> Lithuania, <hi>by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the</hi> Rebells <hi>to their due obedience to his</hi> Majeſty, <hi>Hee aſſured him</hi> that <hi>hee would not onely re eſtabliſh him in his</hi> inheritance, <hi>but render him (next the</hi> King) <hi>the greateſt and richeſt</hi> Nobleman <hi>of all</hi> Polonia <hi>and</hi> Lithuania. This Propoſition was ſpecious enough to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the <hi>heart,</hi> and open the <hi>Ears</hi> of the ambitious <hi>Liante;</hi> But obſerve in what conſideration the Point of <hi>Honour</hi> is to a Generous <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your promiſe is very great,</hi> anſwered hee, <hi>But if, to obtein all that you proffer, I muſt commit (I will not ſay</hi>) Treaſon <hi>or</hi> Diſloyalty, <hi>but the leaſt</hi> Treachery, <hi>move mee no farther; For, might I bee rewarded by the purchaſe of a whole</hi> Kingdome, <hi>I would not violate my</hi> Faith, <hi>nor offend the</hi> Hoſpitality <hi>of</hi> Olavius, <hi>who by his</hi> Courteſies <hi>hath heaped upon mee ſo many extraordinary</hi> Obligations, <hi>that I must remain his</hi> debter <hi>all my</hi> Life, <hi>and at the laſt yet</hi> die <hi>inſolvable. Beſides I have ſuch</hi> confidence <hi>in the</hi> Gallantry <hi>of your</hi> Soul (<hi>dear</hi> Brother) <hi>that I believe a baſe</hi> action <hi>can have no admittance into your</hi> thoughts; <hi>For, I know how high an eſteemer, and how</hi> jealous <hi>a preſerver you ever have been of</hi> Honour. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> having commended the generoſity of <hi>Liante's</hi> anſwer, told him, <hi>that</hi> hee was ſo far from ingaging him in any diſhonourable act, that hee would firſt remit his own <hi>Perſon</hi> into his <hi>Hands,</hi> to open him the way they were to follow for the reducing of <hi>Lithuania</hi> unto the <hi>King's</hi> Subjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> having asked him the particulars of that enterpriſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>after your having worſted my</hi> Father, <hi>I would have you have the</hi> honour <hi>of taking mee</hi> Priſoner, <hi>and then beeing with you I will teach you the</hi> ſecret <hi>to content all thoſe who have ſo much obliged</hi> you; <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring them or blemiſhing your own</hi> honour, <hi>make you the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable</hi> Subject <hi>in this</hi> Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The pledge that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> offered was ſo pretious (giving himſelf in pawn to the <hi>Lithuanians</hi>) that <hi>Liante</hi> believed his <hi>Heart</hi> intended no other than what his <hi>Tongue</hi> declared. Therefore having impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned him to give a more particular inſtruction of his Deſign; <hi>Brother</hi> (ſaid Iphigenes) <hi>The</hi> King <hi>before my coming to this</hi> Siege, <hi>commanded mee expreſly by</hi> Letters <hi>to return to</hi> Court, <hi>aſſuring mee that I ſhould bee better welcom than ever; and</hi> that <hi>at length the</hi> Sun <hi>of</hi> Truth <hi>had pierced and diſſipated the</hi> Fogs <hi>of my Envier's</hi> Calumnies: <hi>Nevertheleſs the</hi> deſire <hi>of rendering him ſome remarkable teſtimonies of my</hi> Fideſity <hi>in the occurrence of this</hi> War, <hi>made mee prefer the</hi> toyles <hi>and</hi> perilis <hi>of this</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:51476:149"/> Martiall <hi>Life before the delicious</hi> Recreations <hi>of</hi> Cracovia. <hi>This</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>of his</hi> Majeſtie's <hi>Affection, beget's in mee an</hi> hope, <hi>nay a</hi> Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>that (his</hi> favour <hi>to mee beeing not extinguiſhed) upon the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my</hi> impriſonment, <hi>hee will at what rate ſoever purchaſe my</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement, <hi>either by</hi> ranſom, <hi>or by</hi> force. <hi>Now, what fairer oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity can you deſire to regain your</hi> inheritance <hi>than this? eſpecially when I ſhall have certified His</hi> Majeſty <hi>that not any</hi> deſire <hi>of revolting or diſſerving him, induced you to aſſociate your ſelf with theſe</hi> Rebells; <hi>but the</hi> fear <hi>of falling into</hi> Mieſlas <hi>Hands, and the</hi> Deſpair <hi>whereinto his</hi> cruelty <hi>reduced you. I will do more; For, beeing fully informed of his</hi> Majeſtie's <hi>temper and intentions, my</hi> fancy <hi>promiſeth mee that I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the two</hi> Palatines (<hi>now beſieged) to lay down their</hi> Arms, <hi>and reſtore</hi> Peace <hi>to this</hi> Province, <hi>with ſuch advantages to their Families, and the whole Country of</hi> Lithuania, <hi>that the</hi> Generality <hi>of this</hi> Nation <hi>ſhall have cauſe to extoll their</hi> Sovereign's <hi>goodneſs, and They be particularly obliged to his</hi> Clemency <hi>and</hi> Liberality.</p>
               <p>How ſhould <hi>Liante</hi> not bee overcome by the charms of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which were ſo far above his <hi>Hopes,</hi> that hee ſcarce durſt ſoar to them with his <hi>Deſires?</hi> And although hee adviſed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (if hee were not very well aſſured of the <hi>King's</hi> affection) not to expoſe himſelf to that adventure, nothing under <hi>Heaven</hi> beeing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than the inclinations of <hi>Men,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Princes,</hi> whoſe chiefeſt tye is their Intereſt: yet hee was conſtreined to yeild to <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> intreaty, which overbalanced his perſwaſions. Then they agreed to contrive the taking of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſo, that (although it was premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) t ſhould ſeem caſuall. Their plot was thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> for certaine dayes ſucceſſively ſhould ride pckeering, and diſcharge his Piſtolls againſt the Gates of the <hi>City</hi> (as <hi>Gentlemen</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do to ſhew the gallantry of their Courages and Activity, truſting for their retreat to the goodneſs of their Horſes, and ſwiftneſs of their Courſe;) after which, at a prefixed time, <hi>Liante</hi> ſhould ſet ſome Souldiers in <hi>Ambuſcado</hi> to inveſt him. Which was as handſomly effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ingeniouſly projected.</p>
               <p>At this newes repreſent to your imagination the fury of <hi>Mieſtas,</hi> the trouble of the <hi>Royall Camp;</hi> and on the contrary the rejoycing of the beſieged, and with what <hi>Laurells</hi> they loaded <hi>Liante's</hi> head. <hi>Ola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> beeing no longer able to contein his <hi>joy,</hi> ran to imbrace him, and extolling his fortunate <hi>Valour</hi> to the Skies, hee offered him the choice of his two Daughters, with ſuch a part of his eſtate as hee would pleaſe to demand for a Dowry.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:51476:149"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante,</hi> well contented with thoſe triumphs and trophies, which they erected to a <hi>Victory</hi> that coſt him ſo little, perceived thereby how vain the judgement of the <hi>World</hi> is, and that as <hi>puniſhments</hi> are not alwayes inflicted on the moſt <hi>wicked</hi> perſons, but the leaſt <hi>fortunate;</hi> So <hi>Glory</hi> was an infamous <hi>Courtiſan,</hi> which caſt herſelf not alwayes into the Arms of the moſt <hi>valiant,</hi> but moſt <hi>ſucceſſefull:</hi> And to incite <hi>Olavius</hi> the more to preſs him to accept a Preſent, which hee ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately deſired, with an artificiall modeſty hee pretended <hi>that</hi> he was unworthy of ſo much <hi>favour,</hi> beeing at that time a diſtreſſed <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> baniſhed from his Country, and diſmantled of all his Eſtate by an injuſt <hi>Confiſcation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Olavius,</hi> falling of himſelf into the Nets, replied, <hi>That the</hi> reſtitution <hi>of his</hi> inheritance <hi>would bee the leaſt part of the brave</hi> Priſoner's <hi>ranſom, wherewith hee had</hi> inriched <hi>their</hi> City, <hi>and</hi> that <hi>hee ought not to ſtick upon that</hi> conſideration, <hi>in regard hee had alwayes reſpected him more for his</hi> Vertues <hi>than his</hi> Fortune, <hi>eſteeming it more</hi> advantage <hi>for his</hi> Daughter <hi>to have a</hi> Man <hi>that wanted</hi> means, <hi>than</hi> means <hi>that wanted a</hi> Man. But <hi>Liante</hi> demanding time to deliberate more at leiſure upon that buſineſs, deſired him to thinke of treating <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with ſuch <hi>Civility,</hi> that hee might have juſt occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend rather than complain of <hi>Lithuania.</hi> Which was performed in ſuch honourable manner, that if the gallant <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had been <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> of that rebellious <hi>City,</hi> hee could not have received greater reſpect. Hee had no other <hi>Priſon</hi> than his own <hi>Parolle, Liante</hi> rendering himſelf pledge for his fidelity.</p>
               <p>Since the beginning of the <hi>Siege,</hi> the two <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Troc</hi> and <hi>Minſce</hi> had ſecured their Wives, Children, and what they had of moſt conſiderable value in the Caſtle, as the place of greateſt ſafety; there <hi>Liante</hi> likewiſe had his Quarters, neer which they conducted <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> into a Chamber, ſo richly furniſhed, that in the <hi>King's</hi> Pallace hee could not have been lodged more ſplendidly. Good <hi>Cheer</hi> was no more wanting than all ſorts of <hi>Games</hi> and honourable <hi>divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The company of <hi>Ladies</hi> was his ordinary attendance; For, they had no ſooner taſted the inevitable charms of his converſation, but they became more licouriſh and greedy of it, than <hi>Bees</hi> are of <hi>Flowers,</hi> or their <hi>Hony</hi>-combs.</p>
               <p>If that beautifull Face (which ſhewed to <hi>Mortalls</hi> the image of the <hi>Angells</hi>) had infected with it's pleaſing <hi>Poyſon</hi> the <hi>Court-Ladie's</hi> hearts, imagine you how thoſe of <hi>Lithuania</hi> could be exempted from

               <p>
                  <hi>Bogdales</hi> had a Wife ſo advanced in years, that the blood of her veines (which ought by the courſe of <hi>Nature</hi> to have been Icie) ſeem'd exempted (by the benefite of her <hi>Age</hi>) from thoſe ardours, which are onely excuſable in <hi>youth;</hi> with her was retired into that <hi>Caſtle</hi> a <hi>Daughter,</hi> which Hee had married to a gallant <hi>Nobleman</hi> of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> who not delighting to bee incloſed within the walls of that beſleged <hi>City,</hi> kept a flying <hi>Army</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> accompanied by the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Trod's</hi> Son, his <hi>Brother-in-law.</hi> His merit was ſufficient to have made all the <hi>Affections</hi> of his <hi>Wife</hi> terminate in his <hi>Perſon;</hi> but the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the beautifull <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſo perverted her <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that as the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> by a violent motion drawe's all the other <hi>ſphears</hi> after it, ſhee could not hinder her <hi>Heart</hi> from following her <hi>Eyes,</hi> whoſe too inconſiderate looks betrayed the licentiouſneſs of her thoughts. So that the <hi>Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Daughter</hi> were both taken in the ſame ſnare at once.</p>
               <p>Neither could <hi>Olavius</hi> Wife (as wiſe and reſerved as ſhee was) withhold the motions of her <hi>Minde</hi> from <hi>Dancing</hi> the ſame <hi>brawle.</hi> And as if that rare <hi>Object</hi> had been formed on purpoſe to ruine the <hi>conſtancy</hi> of the moſt <hi>continent,</hi> few ſaw him without taking pleaſure to behold him, and few beheld him without ſtrange allarms and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Spirit.</hi> That <hi>fire</hi> muſt bee very fierce which preſently take's in green <hi>Wood.</hi>

               <p>Onely the poor <hi>Oloria</hi> remained conſtant in her affection to him who deſpiſed her; For, her Soul beeing filled with the <hi>Idea</hi> of that firſt <hi>Object,</hi> was inſuſceptible of any other impreſſion.

               <p>To relate the diſtemper which theſe new <hi>Paſſions</hi> bred in thoſe weak <hi>Brains,</hi> I dare not undertake, much leſs to expreſs the <hi>confuſions</hi> that imbroyled their <hi>thoughts;</hi> For, <hi>Love, Envy, Deſpair, Jealouſie, Shame</hi> &amp; <hi>Deſire,</hi> were as many <hi>Worms,</hi> or rather <hi>Vultures</hi> that gnawed continually their Breſts.

               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:51476:151"/>
               <p>As for <hi>Amiclea,</hi> though ſhee began to have age enough to diſcern, ſhee had not enough to diſſemble ſufficiently her Reſentments: For, a firſt <hi>love</hi> is like new <hi>Wine,</hi> which burſt's the <hi>Veſſell</hi> if it hath not <hi>vent.</hi> VVhilſt for <hi>Liante</hi> her <hi>mind</hi> was leſs agitated, it was eaſie for her to contein herſelf: But a vehement and extraordinary <hi>Paſſion</hi> is not ſo eaſily concealed, which made her above all the reſt give evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of her <hi>flame.</hi> VVhich was very excuſable in her; For, beſides the glory of captiving ſo gallant a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and poſſeſſing ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed a <hi>Body,</hi> what <hi>Soul</hi> is ſo ſtupid as not to bee pricked with the ſpur of <hi>ambition,</hi> ſeeing a <hi>Noble</hi> perſon illuſtrated with ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Dignities,</hi> and accompanied with <hi>Riches</hi> that had no limits (ſince they were founded upon the favour of one of the greateſt <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi>) Beſides the common deſire of all young <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> to bee highly and richly married, and render themſelves agreeable and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all Eyes?</p>
               <p>In ſumme, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was the <hi>Object</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Ladies</hi> Eſteem, and of their attendants, as they were the <hi>Butts</hi> of his Contempt; But as they accounted themſelves honoured with his company, ſo and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf importuned by their's. At length <hi>Oloria</hi> as well as the reſt, if not in effect, at leaſt in appearance, ſeemed to be intrapped in his Snares: For, whether out of a deſire to bee revenged of <hi>Liante's</hi> ſcorns, or (which is more probable) to reduce him to her affections by the ſting of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> ſhee feigned at firſt to love <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and ſtuck not to give him ſeverall manifeſt proofs of her <hi>inclinations:</hi> But by little and little ſhee ingaged herſelf ſo far, that her Counterfeiting became a Reality. VVhich made her fall from bad to worſe, and in ſtead of a <hi>Body</hi> run after a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> which fled from her: For, if ſhee had been ſo unfortunate as not to bee able to caſt any bait before <hi>Liante's</hi> Heart, that might oblige him to ſet any value upon her <hi>Affection,</hi> judge you how that <hi>train</hi> could take in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Boſome, who was ſo little capable not onely of ſatisfying her deſires, but of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any <hi>inclination</hi> for her.</p>
               <p>Thus our lovely <hi>Priſoner,</hi> the <hi>Rock</hi> and ſtumbling-<hi>block</hi> of their thoughts, was innocently culpable of all their pains. But hee had more intricate troubles to quell in his own breſt, without imbroyling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their follies: For, hee was not like the <hi>Sun,</hi> which warmeth all things elſe, not having any degree of heat within himſelf.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51476:151"/> the <hi>ſubmiſſions</hi> and <hi>devoirs,</hi> wherewith the paſſionate <hi>Liante</hi> beſieged the <hi>Heart</hi> of the diſdainfull <hi>Amiclea?</hi> what deſpight poſſeſſed him to ſee the Pride of that ſcornfull <hi>Rivall,</hi> who robbed him of that which hee eſteemed moſt pretious, the affection of <hi>Liante?</hi> and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other advantage than that of her habit. If you had ſeen him at any time contemplating his excellent Features in a <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> you would have ſaid <hi>that</hi> hee had been making a ſtrict inquiry in that <hi>Chrystall,</hi> concerning the <hi>Victory</hi> which his <hi>Beauty,</hi> in the <hi>Full,</hi> gave him over the <hi>Creſſant</hi> of <hi>Amiclea's.</hi> Nothing remained in his opinion, but to unſeel <hi>Liante's</hi> Eyes, and let him underſtand his condition, to make him quit the <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Pretentions</hi> hee had for that unpoliſht <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> But this was the main difficulty, which bred a diſturbance in his thoughts, no leſs dolorous than the throes of a <hi>Woman,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to conceale her labour dare's not cry out in her greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

               <p>An antient <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> make's mention of a <hi>Souldier,</hi> who deſpairing of his <hi>Life</hi> by reaſon of an inteſtine <hi>Pain,</hi> which tormented him, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into the hotteſt of the <hi>Battle</hi> to purchaſe an honourable <hi>Death,</hi> received a thruſt with a <hi>Sword</hi> through the Body, which broke an <hi>Impoſtume</hi> within, and was ſo favourable to him, that hee found <hi>health</hi> where hee expected <hi>Death.</hi> Oh how deſirable were that <hi>ſtroak</hi> with the <hi>Tongue,</hi> that would make <hi>Liante</hi> underſtand what the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicity</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> forced him to conceale, with ſo much prejudice to his own contentment! Sometimes hee reſolved to write, and employ to that Office the whiteneſs of Paper, which is incapable of bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But repreſenting to his more ſerious conſideration the divers inconveniences that might proceed from committing that ſecret to a <hi>Letter,</hi> and it's weakneſs in compariſon of the force of words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Viva voce</hi> in like occurrences, hee changed that Reſolution. And then, as if hee would premeditate the <hi>Speech</hi> of his <hi>manifeſtation,</hi> the diſorder of his thoughts ſtifled the words in his mouth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to the tearms of induring the obſcure <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Silence,</hi> rather than prolong his <hi>Life</hi> by a <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which in his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee ſhould never have the confidence to utter.</p>
               <p>Oh ſacred <hi>Baſhfulneſs!</hi> a quality inſeparable to all well borne <hi>Souls,</hi> how thou painteſt with different colours the <hi>Faces</hi> of ſuch as are ſubject to thy allarmes!

Is it poſſible that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> wit ſo full of ſubtility, and whoſe quaint inventions were ſo eſteemed at <hi>Court,</hi> ſhould remain ſterile in this occurrence, when the moſt important <hi>affaire</hi> that ever hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in all his <hi>Life</hi> was in agitation? In ſumme, wee muſt conclude, what <hi>valour</hi> ſoever wee admire in him, there was yet ſome dram of the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of his <hi>Sex,</hi> which hath the property of beeing extream ſubtile in matters of ſmall conſequence, but little capable of great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes.</p>
               <p>Diſpatch brave <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and quickly raviſh <hi>Liante's</hi> Heart by a free <hi>Declaration;</hi> this <hi>Pill</hi> is ſomewhat bitter. this <hi>Draught</hi> unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the <hi>taſte,</hi> But it muſt bee ſwallowed, for his <hi>good</hi> as well as your's. You poſſeſs ſuch great advantages in all reſpects above your <hi>Rivall,</hi> that you ſhall onely need to unveile your ſelf to cover her with darkneſs, or do her the ſame affront as the <hi>Sun's</hi> arrivall doth to the <hi>Heaven's</hi> meaner Lights.

               </p>
               <p>But whether the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of thoſe <hi>Ladies</hi> that beſieged him, or whether the <hi>Palatines</hi> had commanded them to let <hi>Iphigenes</hi> have the leaſt private Conference that might bee with <hi>Liante,</hi> leſt they ſhould plot ſome conſpiracy, it beeing a <hi>Maxime</hi> of <hi>War</hi> alwayes to diſtruſt an <hi>Enemy;</hi> The time paſſed, and <hi>Iphigenes</hi> conſumed like a <hi>Torch,</hi> that give's <hi>light</hi> to others, and hath nothing but <hi>darkneſs</hi> for it ſelf, meeting with no occaſion to make this deſired Diſcovery to <hi>Liante.</hi> Not but that hee ſpake with him every day, but it was in the preſence of many ſhee-witneſſes, in whoſe hearing hee had no will to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that <hi>Secret.</hi> Inſomuch that in this condition hee languiſhed, beeing <hi>Heart</hi> burned with <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> which like a devouring fire inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly increaſed, as hee perceived <hi>Liante</hi> more earneſt, and publick in his <hi>reſearch</hi> of <hi>Amiclea,</hi> declaring himſelf upon all occaſions her <hi>Vaſſall,</hi> though (her <hi>Eyes</hi> beeing dazled with the luſter of the rare <hi>Priſoner's</hi> beauty) ſhee made no great account of his ſervices.</p>
               <p>It would bee a no leſs tedious than difficult task to relate the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects of thoſe <hi>Ladies</hi> paſſions; For, if <hi>Envy</hi> agitated the old <hi>Matrons, Jealouſie</hi> bred no leſs diſtemper in the young <hi>Damſell's</hi> thoughts. I ſhall content my ſelf to remarke onely their contrarieties. The two <hi>Palatineſſes</hi> ſtrove with an envious Emulation, which ſhould
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51476:152"/> render beſt Offices to the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> ſo far forth as to let him ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, if hee would have underſtood them, that thoſe indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proceeded as much from <hi>Love</hi> as <hi>Courteſie.</hi> The <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Troc's</hi> Daughter managed her affection with more Dexterity; yet <hi>Iphigenes</hi> perceived but too plainly all her ſubtilities. <hi>Oloria</hi> leſs cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in her carriage, diſcovered through her ſimplicity ſo much folly, that ſhee made <hi>Pitty</hi> grow where ſhee intended to Plant <hi>Deſire.</hi> The tender <hi>Amiclea,</hi> by reaſon of her youth, beeing more inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and by conſequent more hardy, not contented with a free ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of her inclinations to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> promiſed him to contrive his eſcape, upon condition that hee would carry her with him and make her his Wife, in acknowledgement of the <hi>liberty</hi> which ſhee ingaged herſelf to procure him. But hee who was more bound by his own <hi>will</hi> than his <hi>Parolle,</hi> and more impriſoned by his <hi>Paſſion</hi> than thoſe <hi>Walls,</hi> although the <hi>Gates</hi> had been ſet wide open, would not have gone out of that place. whereinto hee had invented ſuch ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems to enter. So that thanking her for her courteous offer (for beeing a <hi>Priſoner</hi> upon <hi>Parolle</hi> hee would not for a <hi>World</hi> falſifie his word) hee left her in a continuall <hi>Feaver,</hi> whoſe violence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled ſometimes by <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of her <hi>young</hi> Rivals, ſometimes by the <hi>fury</hi> of the <hi>old,</hi> who under pretence of watching his deportments, were angry that her <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> gave her more acceſs to <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> than any other. In a word, they were like ſo many Archers, who ſhoot all at the ſame Marke, yet take their aym from ſeverall ſtations.</p>
               <p>Among diverſe other means which thoſe amorous <hi>Ladies</hi> uſed to make time ſeem leſs tedious to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> beſides Gaming and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (whereof hee had full liberty, ſo that hee were accompanied) the divertiſement of <hi>Converſation,</hi> as it was moſt agreeable, was moſt uſuall with them. Among other exerciſes of <hi>Converſation,</hi> ſome there are conſiſting of the commendable and witty invention of <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Fancies,</hi> which onely tend to an honeſt and recreative Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some of the moſt ingenious of thoſe <hi>Rivalls</hi> made uſe of this means, to make their adored <hi>Object</hi> covertly underſtand divers things which the <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Modeſty</hi> of their condition permitted them not to diſcloſe any other way. To this <hi>Iphigenes</hi> made <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> his <hi>Buckler,</hi> ſeeming as if hee conceived not their meaning, although hee penetrated to the bottome of their <hi>Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One day it hapned that to entertain the Company, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:51476:153"/> and reſolved, every one ſhould tell a Story, and <hi>that</hi> Hee or Shee who, according to moſt Voyces, could relate the ſtrangeſt <hi>Evene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſhould bee recompenſed with a <hi>Garland</hi> of <hi>Flowers,</hi> and a <hi>Kiſs</hi> from all the reſt of the Aſſembly. I ſhould ſpin out the Thred of this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to a too unmeaſurable length, if I ſhould ſtand to repeate what every <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Gentleman</hi> of that Society related. Beſides, my intention beeing onely to write the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> I doe not think my ſelf obliged to mention any thing, but what concern's him, or fell from his mouth in this occurrence; which was a ſit occaſion (as hee thought) to open <hi>Liante's</hi> Eyes, and gently prepare him to receive the light of that Truth, which hee deſired to make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
               <p>So then, after it was come to the beloved <hi>Priſoner's</hi> turn to ſpeak, and that by induſtrious excuſes (purpoſely invented) hee had ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the deſire of his Auditours (whoſe <hi>Ears</hi> were no leſs covetous of <hi>hearing,</hi> than their <hi>Eyes</hi> charmed with <hi>ſeeing</hi> him) as if hee had been overcome by the intreaties of ſo many perſons worthy of reſpect, hee acquitted himſelf of the charge impoſed upon him, beginning his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since theſe</hi> Ladies <hi>and</hi> Gentlemen <hi>who have ſpoken before mee, have imbelliſhed with ſuch exquiſite</hi> Flowers <hi>of</hi> Rhetorick <hi>the strange</hi> Evene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>which they have reported as well of</hi> Men <hi>as</hi> Women, <hi>it would bee a vain</hi> ambition <hi>in mee to</hi> aſpire <hi>to the</hi> atchivement <hi>of the promiſed</hi> Crown, <hi>and that delicate</hi> Kiſs <hi>which is the</hi> Crown <hi>of that</hi> Crown, <hi>if my</hi> Hope <hi>flattered mee not that the ſtrangeneſs of the</hi> Fable <hi>I ſhall tell you, would ſupply my defect of</hi> Elegance; <hi>For, already I renounce the</hi> prize <hi>as in reference to the</hi> Ornaments <hi>of</hi> Language, <hi>and other parts requiſite to the perfection of a</hi> Diſcourſe: <hi>But whether I am too indulgent to my own</hi> Judgement, <hi>or that the</hi> Truth <hi>is ſuch, as that it make's it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, I never hitherto read any</hi> Story <hi>comparable to the ſtrangeneſs of what you now ſhall hear. For, I beſeech you</hi> (worthy Aſſembly) <hi>Can there bee any thing more</hi> miraculous, <hi>than that the ſame</hi> perſon <hi>ſhould be both</hi> Man <hi>and</hi> Woman <hi>without beeing an</hi> Hermaphrodite? <hi>Conſider how this</hi> Prodigy <hi>can enter into your</hi> thoughts; <hi>and if your</hi> imaginations <hi>cannot form the</hi> Idea <hi>of this</hi> Miracle, <hi>acknowledge e're I proceed, that what I ſhall let you hear ſurmounteth all</hi> conception. <hi>If your</hi> Spirits <hi>were no leſs</hi> amazed <hi>than</hi> delighted <hi>with the extraordiary accidents you have already heard, you are to conſider</hi> that <hi>thoſe hapned to</hi> Men <hi>or</hi> Women <hi>diſtinctly; But what</hi> Monſter, <hi>in your Opinion, ſhould</hi> hee <hi>bee,</hi> that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               </p>
               <p>Then, mixing the reall <hi>Story</hi> of his own Birth and Education, and his inviolable affection to <hi>Liante,</hi> with the <hi>Fable</hi> of <hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Ianthe,</hi> illuſtrated by the Pen of the moſt ingenious of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, Hee diſguiſed all the paſſages ſo quaintly, and amplified his Relation with ſuch eloquent Expreſſions, that hee left all their <hi>Ears</hi> (as it were) gaping, and their <hi>Spirits</hi> ſuſpended with admiration at the ſtrangeneſs of that <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> and the delicacy of his Language: When <hi>Liante</hi> (who perceived by their indulgent looks, that all the <hi>voyces</hi> were ready to allot the <hi>Crown</hi> to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and that <hi>Kiſs,</hi> of which (for <hi>Amiclea's</hi> ſake) hee was moſt paſſionately covetous) ſaid, <hi>Ladies I oppoſe your</hi> Votes, <hi>and believe that the prize will bee adjudged to</hi> mee, <hi>if you do mee</hi> Juſtice.</p>
               <p>What Juſtice? replied the <hi>Palatineſs</hi> of <hi>Troc. Madam,</hi> anſwered hee, <hi>that I may relate a</hi> verity <hi>lately arrived, which ſurpaſſeth in ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the</hi> vanity <hi>of this</hi> fiction, <hi>wherewith</hi> Iphigenes <hi>hath fed your Ears. If you allow mee the advantage that</hi> Hiſtories <hi>have of</hi> Fables, <hi>I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident I ſhall win. Iphigenes</hi> no leſs aſtoniſhed than the reſt, caſting his Eyes upon <hi>Liante's</hi> Face (the ordinary aym of his tendreſt looks) diſpoſed himſelf to hearken with attention, when <hi>Liante</hi> explained his Speech in theſe words (which ſounded as the voyce of <hi>Thunder</hi> in the Ears of the troubled <hi>Iphigenes:) Without borrowing any other</hi> perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages <hi>than who are preſent in this Room, I will change you this</hi> Fable <hi>into an</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>and by the</hi> judgement <hi>of</hi> Iphigenes <hi>himſelf (after I have related it) I queſtion not but the</hi> prize <hi>will bee mine without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. In few words,</hi> Ladies, <hi>this</hi> Fable <hi>is nothing elſe but the</hi> Hiſtory <hi>of</hi> Iphigenes <hi>and my ſelf; do you not ſee, by reflecting upon the Names, how that of his feined</hi> Iphis <hi>agreeth with his own, and mine with</hi> Ianthe's?</p>
               <p>If the roof of <hi>Heaven</hi> had ſeemed to break over <hi>Iphigenes</hi> head, hee would have been leſs ſurpriſed than at this Diſcourſe, whereof dreading the <hi>ſequele</hi> more than the hand of <hi>Death,</hi> hee indeavoured to divert it, or at leaſt remit it untill another time, and that <hi>hee</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the interim with <hi>Liante,</hi> who (hee believed) had ſounded the depth of his intentions. But ſeeing that hee could not withſtand the <hi>Torrent</hi> of the <hi>Ladie's</hi> curioſities, who preſſed <hi>Liante</hi> with no leſs
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51476:154"/> importunity to ſpeake, than hee conjured him to bee ſilent; at length hee was conſtreined to make uſe of that authority which his <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> had alwayes given him over that beloved <hi>Brother-in-law,</hi> forbidding him under pain of his indignation to proceed any farther untill hee had ſpoken two words with him, which hee eſteemed of no ſlighter importance than his <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The grave and ſtern Countenance, with the ſharp and angry tone, wherewith <hi>Iphigenes</hi> pronounced that threat, ſtopt the current of <hi>Liante's</hi> Speech no leſs miraculouſly than a little <hi>Remora</hi> make's a tall Ship ſtand ſtill in the midſt of the working <hi>Ocean,</hi> though the windes had filled all her Sailes. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> without loſing time, preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Liante</hi> in private, after what manner hee intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite that <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and having learn't that hee would onely apply it to their recreative transformations in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Plocens,</hi> not a little pleaſed that <hi>Liante</hi> had penetrated no farther into his <hi>Secret,</hi> ſerenity returned into his <hi>Face,</hi> the panting of his <hi>Heart</hi> ceaſed, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected his <hi>Spirits</hi> hee ſaid to the Aſſembly; <hi>My Laidies, that which</hi> Liante <hi>is about to tell you, is indeed a reall</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>but it ſeem's as like a</hi> Fable, <hi>as my</hi> Fable <hi>hath th'appearance of an</hi> Hiſtory; <hi>it is the</hi> relation <hi>of his</hi> Follies <hi>and mine, wherein I am confident you will finde nothing of ſuch</hi> admiration, <hi>but that it's ſtrangeneſs will excite you rather to</hi> laughter <hi>than</hi> aſtoniſhment. <hi>Therefore without deſpairing of the</hi> Crown, <hi>and the</hi> Favour <hi>that is to follow it, I ſhall let him ſpeak, beſeeching you not to ground your</hi> Sentence <hi>upon the</hi> Art <hi>of his</hi> Eloquence, <hi>which is able to illuſtrate the meaneſt</hi> Subjects, <hi>and make a</hi> Chryſtall <hi>paſs for a</hi> Diamond.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, they having all re-taken their ſeats, compoſed their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and prepared their Ears for attention, <hi>Liante</hi> repeated all the <hi>Miſtakes, Diſguiſements</hi> and pretty <hi>Contrivances</hi> practiſed for their recreation in the Woods, in the ſame manner as hath already been deſcribed; whereunto hee added the <hi>tranſveſtment</hi> of his Siſter <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtina,</hi> and how ſhee had been treated by command of the barbarous <hi>Mieſlas.</hi> But having run through this long <hi>Navigation,</hi> without touching any <hi>Rock,</hi> juſt at the <hi>Haven's</hi> mouth hee caſt <hi>Iphigenes</hi> into a new perplexity. For, coming to mention the <hi>non</hi>-conſummated Marriage of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> and the pretentions of the <hi>Princeſs Respicia,</hi> adding the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of ſome other <hi>Ladies</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> and the report that was ſpred through all <hi>Polonia</hi> of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the <hi>Shepherdeſs Almeria,</hi> hee repreſented <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſo chaſt,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51476:154"/> ſo baſhfull, and ſo little inclined to <hi>Women,</hi> that hee made him appear not onely as the vertuous <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> but ſo like that <hi>Iphis</hi> in his own <hi>Fable,</hi> (who of a <hi>Woman</hi> was transformed into a <hi>Man</hi>) that without changing the name you would have thought hee had been concerned in that <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This redoubled <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Feaver, confirming his ſuſpition that <hi>Liante</hi> had diſcovered ſomething of that <hi>Miſtery,</hi> which hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been ſo carefull to conceale. At length <hi>Liante</hi> returning to his <hi>Paſſions,</hi> or (as hee called them) his <hi>illuſions</hi> for <hi>Serife</hi> (whom hee deſcribed with tearms beyond my capacity to rehearſe) <hi>My Ladies</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>To the end you and all theſe</hi> Gentlemen <hi>may believe mee, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the beautifull</hi> Palatine <hi>to dreſs himſelf in ſome of your cloathes,</hi> (I aſſure my ſelf your <hi>requeſts</hi> will be as <hi>commands</hi> to him) <hi>and I believe</hi> that <hi>there is not any among you, but will acknowledge that I was happily deceived; for as Hee is too fair for a</hi> Man, <hi>Hee is ſo perfectly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in a</hi> Woman's <hi>habit, that (without excepting her who poſſeſſeth mee) the moſt amorous of herſelf among you all, I am confident will freely yeild to Him the Palm of</hi> Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> hearing this was like unto a <hi>Man,</hi> who ſaved from <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi> by ſome ſloting <hi>Board,</hi> is troubled to get on <hi>ſhoar,</hi> the <hi>waves</hi> ſometimes pitifull, ſometimes cruell, driving him towards the <hi>Land,</hi> and then ſnatching him back againe into the <hi>Sea;</hi> ſometimes raiſing him above the <hi>Water,</hi> ſometimes plunging him into their <hi>briny-bottom.</hi> For, ſeeing <hi>Liante's</hi> Shafts come ſo neer the <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> hee began to harbour a <hi>feare</hi> that his ſecret had been diſcloſed before its time: On the other ſide hee was tranſported with <hi>joy</hi> to ſee <hi>Liante</hi> fall of himſelf into the <hi>Nets</hi> which hee laid for him, and make ſo cleerly manifeſt, unawares, the moſt tender Reſentments of his <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante's</hi> perſwaſions ſo prevailed with the <hi>Ladies,</hi> that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with Conjurations to give their <hi>Eyes</hi> the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to behold under ſome of their rich ornaments the choyceſt Jewell of <hi>Nature's</hi> pretious Treaſury. Whereunto <hi>Iphigenes</hi> after many excuſes condeſcended, to their unſpeakable admiration, and the abſolute <hi>raviſhment</hi> of <hi>Liante's</hi> Heart, which was his onely am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and for which conſideration hee was no leſs <hi>willing</hi> to tranſveſt himſelf than they <hi>earneſt</hi> to deſire it, to the end hee might again in that equipage dazle <hi>Liante's</hi> Eyes, and renew in his Breſt that <hi>Idea</hi> which had rendered him his <hi>ſlave</hi> in the <hi>Foreſt.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>King</hi> having received this Packet, ſeriouſly reflected upon the advice of his beloved <hi>Favorite,</hi> of whoſe wit and vertue hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes made no meane account, but nothing comparable to the eſteem hee conceived of him on this occaſion, ſeeing with what <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> hee changed his <hi>private</hi> Diſaſter into the <hi>Publick</hi> good. And in effect hee ſerved the <hi>King</hi> in this occurrence as the <hi>Dolphin</hi> is ſaid to ſerve Fiſhermen, who finding him in their Nets, after ſtroaking and careſſing him, caſt him again into the Sea, becauſe hee leads into their hands the other Fiſhes, which in great trains attend him as their <hi>Prince.</hi> But alas! as in a calme ſeaſon when the <hi>Dolphins</hi> ſport above the water, it is the infallible preſage of a ſtorm; So, while <hi>Iphigenes</hi> laboured, in playing, to procure a <hi>publick</hi> tranquillity, a Tempeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe with ſuch impetuoſity, that hee had almoſt periſhed; neither could it be appeaſed notwithſtanding all his induſtry, but by wracking the <hi>ſecret</hi> which hee had ſo many years conceal'd.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the <hi>King</hi> was deliberating his affairs, having commanded the moſt truſty, and beſt experienced of his <hi>Councill</hi> to adviſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the meanes of quenching that <hi>fire</hi> which threatned both his States of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> with a vaſt ruine, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> by a ſodain Guſt ſaw all his hopes upon the very brink of Deſtruction. For, <hi>Ola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> ſeeing the great aſcendant <hi>Liante</hi> had over the Spirit of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and that <hi>Hee</hi> had no leſs over the <hi>King's;</hi> The Politick <hi>Lithuanian</hi> conceived that there was no better means to <hi>moare</hi> his Veſſell at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> and ſecure himſelf from the Shipwrack that threatned his <hi>Fortune,</hi> than by marrying his Daughters. The aſpiring to the alliance of <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> was what hee <hi>deſired</hi> more than hee durſt <hi>hope.</hi> Oh! if <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea's</hi> glances had penetrated as deep into that <hi>Favorite's</hi> breſt, as they had done in <hi>Liante's,</hi> what great matters would hee have promiſed to his <hi>Ambition!</hi> But (beſides that hee knew <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was Married to <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> and was not ignorant of the Deſignes of the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia</hi>) ſeeing the great indifferency that beloved <hi>Captive</hi> ſhewed for all <hi>Women,</hi> as hee loſt the <hi>Hope</hi> of atchieving ſo high an advantage, hee quitted the thought of deſiring it. Which made him turn all his pretenſions towards <hi>Liante,</hi> promiſing himſelf to obtain of the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> what hee ſhould demand of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> by <hi>Liante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this <hi>Palatine</hi> had an ambition to make <hi>Liante</hi> his Son-in-Law, <hi>Liante</hi> was no leſs deſirous than Hee to contract that alliance: But hee was not ſo ſimple as to take the <hi>Elder</hi> for the <hi>Younger,</hi> there

               <p>Since <hi>Oloria</hi> had turned her Eyes towards <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> beeing tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the raviſhing Garbe of that beautifull <hi>Object,</hi> ſhee ſlighted <hi>Liante's</hi> ſcorns; The ſame cauſe made <hi>Amiclea</hi> diſdain the eſteem which <hi>Liante</hi> made of her, and nothing was ſo irkſome to her, as when hee entertained her with the diſcourſe of his <hi>Paſſion.</hi>

                  <hi>Melindra,</hi> Daughter to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Troc,</hi> beeing aſſaulted on one ſide by the Legitimate <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which ſhee owed to her abſent <hi>Husband,</hi> and on the other by the <hi>Charms</hi> which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> caſt into her thoughts, felt Combats of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> in her Heart, whoſe convulſions approached the torments of a <hi>Woman</hi> in travell, who would but cannot bee delivered. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict or violent oppoſition that <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> make in the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a <hi>Clowd,</hi> is ſome reſemblance of the Contradictions in her <hi>Minde.</hi> And after many paſſionate Complaints continuing to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate her <hi>ſore</hi> with a thouſand various imaginations, ſhee impoiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Humour</hi> more, and ſometimes ſhunned the remedy, ſometimes deſired it with impatience. Nevertheleſs ſhee remained ſo firm in the ſteps of <hi>Vertue,</hi> that although her languiſhing looks, broken ſighes, and tears diſcovered plainly enough her diſtemper to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> yet ſhee obſerved a ſevere ſilence, never giving her <hi>Tongue</hi> the liberty to ſay any thing, but what was within the bounds of a modeſt <hi>Civility.</hi> Wherein ſhee made appear as much <hi>vertue</hi> as the two old <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> ſhewed little; For, they were grown ſo jealous of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having diſcovered their inclinations, that like <hi>Furies</hi> they were perpetually haunting them, and reprehending in them a fault, which they authorized in their own deportments. I will not ſtain their memory with the extraordinary means, which they uſed to inveigle this <hi>Fiſh</hi> into their <hi>Nets.</hi> Imagine you onely what <hi>Women</hi> can doe, or rather what they cannot do, when animated with a violent <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and in an <hi>Age</hi> whoſe <hi>weakneſs</hi> redouble's the other's <hi>force.</hi> At length Deſpair had made them commit a treachery, and change their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into vengeance, if the Publick neceſſities had not retarded them in their Private animoſities. So they borrowed of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> the ſuccour of <hi>Hope,</hi> which is alwayes ready to aſſiſt the moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who had been beaten with fiercer, and more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtorms at <hi>Court,</hi> laughed at thoſe <hi>Feminine</hi> diviſions, and looked (as from an eminent place) upon thoſe fraile <hi>Veſſels,</hi> agitated
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:51476:163"/> with that violent <hi>tempeſt,</hi> as a <hi>Shittle-cock</hi> in the <hi>Wind,</hi> and the <hi>ſubject</hi> of his <hi>Diſdain.</hi> The aſſault which I am now going to relate was otherwiſe reſented, for it came from the Place that was onely capable of putting <hi>Iphigenes</hi> beyond his <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may conceive already, that it proceeded from <hi>Liante,</hi> whoſe Spirits beeing ſettled, after the motion which <hi>Iphigenes</hi> tranſveſtment had cauſed in his breſt, relapſed into the vehemence of his <hi>Paſſions</hi> for <hi>Amiclea;</hi> whoſe <hi>Scorns</hi> befroſted his <hi>Pretenſions,</hi> as much as her <hi>Graces</hi> inflamed his <hi>Inclinations.</hi> At length, the <hi>Eyes</hi> of thoſe that love, beeing very quick-ſighted, hee perceived it was onely the preſence of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> that ruined his Deſignes, and <hi>that</hi> his <hi>Idoll</hi> was ſo poſſeſſed with the <hi>Idea</hi> of that beautifull <hi>Palatine,</hi> that no other could finde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into <hi>her</hi> Soul.</p>
               <p>This preſently bred <hi>Jealouſie</hi> in <hi>Liante,</hi> and ſo much power hath the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> above the <hi>ties</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> that hee felt the <hi>later</hi> diminiſh, as faſt as the <hi>other</hi> dilated it ſelf in his thoughts.

Afterwards, conſidering to what danger that brave <hi>Palatine</hi> had expoſed himſelf to ſave his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and the promiſes hee made to raiſe him to the moſt eminent Dignities of <hi>Polonia,</hi> if hee would follow his advice (which hee had alwayes found as advantageous as ſincere) that expunged all manner of <hi>Gall</hi> out of his <hi>Heart,</hi> and reſtreined him from doing or ſaying any thing, that might be prejudiciall to ſo pure and inviolable a <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> One of whoſe principall <hi>Effects</hi> beeing <hi>Confidence,</hi> hee reſolved to open his <hi>Heart</hi> to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and diſcover to him as well the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his <hi>Paſſion</hi> for <hi>Amiclea,</hi> as the pricking torments of his <hi>Jealouſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when hee had diſplayed all his diſtempers, the <hi>End</hi> of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was the <hi>Beginning</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> paines; for fearing nothing ſo, much as the loſs of that <hi>Heart,</hi> which hee deſired to keep intire to himſelf, it was an inconceivable torture to his <hi>Minde,</hi> to ſee him ſo violently bent upon another. <hi>Object</hi> Whereupon hee thus ſpake to <hi>Liante; I marvell not at your beeing in</hi> Love, <hi>for the</hi> Subject <hi>deſerves it; But your</hi> Jealouſie <hi>put's my ſenſes beyond all temper; for (I pray) what occaſion have I ever given you to doubt of my</hi> Fidelity? <hi>Obſerve</hi>

I am ſure if I had brought your's to this</hi> teſt, <hi>it would not have indured the</hi> touch, <hi>and you would defend your diſobedience by the advantages that</hi> Love, <hi>who is but a</hi> Child, <hi>poſſeſſeth or'e thoſe</hi> Spirits <hi>that are ſubjected to his</hi> Empire. <hi>See,</hi> Liante, <hi>how I ſurpaſs you in all things, and (which is as much to your</hi> ſhame <hi>as my</hi> honour) <hi>in the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of</hi> Friendſhip; <hi>which is vainly reported to equalize</hi> Friends, <hi>ſince you are inferiour to me by ſo many degrees, that you dare not</hi> think in my favor, <hi>what I would willingly</hi> execute <hi>for your Conſideration. What imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poſſeſſeth your</hi> mind? <hi>do you think to make</hi> Amiclea <hi>love you againſt her</hi> will? <hi>Certainly you underſtand very ill the motions of</hi> Love, <hi>which have no other foundation but the</hi> Liberty <hi>of chooſing, and therefore it is called</hi> Dilection, <hi>as if one ſhould ſay an inclination of</hi> Election. <hi>And you are very ignorant of the humour of</hi> Ladies, <hi>who (like ſhadowes) do uſually follow thoſe that flie them, and ſhun thoſe that follow them. You have reaſon to ſay that</hi> Amiclea <hi>love's mee; hee muſt bee blinde that perceive's it not; ſo do many others, whoſe</hi> Paſſions <hi>are very irkſome to mee: my</hi> Ears <hi>are dayly ſtorm'd with her Complaints, and theſe importunities which are ſo unwelcome to mee, would be ſuch favours to you, as would elevate your thoughts to the Skies. But what ſhould I do in this caſe? I can no more hinder</hi> her <hi>from</hi> loving <hi>mee, than compell</hi> her <hi>to</hi> affect <hi>you.</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>is not ſo eaſily put off as a</hi> Garment, <hi>nothing is more difficult to be done by</hi> devoir <hi>than to</hi> Love. <hi>Shee knowe's that her deſires are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> hope <hi>for my particular, and yet I cannot diſabuſe her of her</hi> Errour, <hi>nor diſſwade her from amuſing her</hi> Fancy <hi>after a</hi> Subject, <hi>which cannot lawfully be her's. I would, for your ſatisfaction, that it were in my power to tranſplant her</hi> Paſſion, <hi>and turn it from my ſelf to you; if this were poſſible, you ſhould finde that among all the</hi> Friends <hi>in the World there never was any more faithfull, nor more deſirous of pleaſing you than I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Jealouſie</hi> reſigned the poſſeſſion of <hi>Liante's</hi> Heart; and hee, acknowledging the ingagements hee had to the incomparable <hi>Friendſhip</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſaid to him: <q>I think <hi>Heaven</hi> hath created you to ſerve as a Spectacle of admiration to all thoſe that ſee you, but much more to thoſe that frequent you. It is impoſſible to hate you, and know you; But what ſay I? I maintain one cannot
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51476:164"/> know you without loving you, no more than ſee the <hi>Sun</hi> without light or heat.

For, never <hi>Man</hi> was ſo beloved of <hi>Women</hi> as you are, and (I think) never any cared leſs for them than you. What? Do you then love none ſo well, but that you could leave her if a faithfull <hi>friend</hi> ſhould intreat you to be unfaithfull to her?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto <hi>Iphigenes</hi> made anſwer, <hi>A perfect</hi> Friend <hi>will never deſire any thing ſo diſhonorable as</hi> infidelity; <hi>but if any</hi> Friend <hi>of mine ſhould be much inflamed for ſome one of that</hi> Sex, <hi>(who to mee are all indifferent) I ſhould make no difficulty to reſigne an</hi> affection, <hi>wherein I were no otherwiſe ingaged than by a</hi> Civile <hi>reſpect; eſpecially if hee had been the firſt pretender. For, I hold it the greateſt injury that can be done to a</hi> Friend, <hi>to indeavour to spoil his market in matter of Marriage, and</hi> that <hi>there is nothing more capable of breaking all</hi> Friendſhip, <hi>than</hi> Jealouſie <hi>proceeding from ſuch a cauſe; in regard it is an offence beyond reparation. There is not hee breathing among</hi> Mortalls <hi>but knowe's that</hi> Love <hi>and</hi> Royalty <hi>admit of no Companions, and</hi> that <hi>they are two</hi> Torrents <hi>which overturn by the impetuoſity of their</hi> Courſe <hi>all ſort of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dear</hi> Iphigenes, <hi>replyed</hi> Liante, <hi>I think thou hast undertaken to tranſport mee quite beyond my ſelf, making mee ſee in thee, not the</hi> Image, <hi>but the</hi> Eſſence <hi>of the moſt perfect</hi> Friend <hi>under the Circumference of the</hi> Firmament. <hi>I deliver up my Arms,</hi> Dear Brother, <hi>and in all wayes acknowledge my ſelf conquered by thee; But ſince thou haſt given mee ſo many times my</hi> Life, <hi>now thou giveſt mee the</hi> Courage <hi>to deſire thee to preſerve in mee thy own</hi> handy-work, <hi>and releaſe mee from the trouble that torment's mee. Know then, that without the poſſeſſion of</hi> Amiclea <hi>I cannot live. And to imbrace the</hi> Body <hi>of one, whoſe</hi> Heart <hi>is with another, is a thing I can as little indure, as to be tied to a breathleſs</hi> Carcaſs; <hi>It would be a puniſhment to mee, not a pleaſure. Therefore I beſeech thee to further mee in the</hi> Conqueſt <hi>of her</hi> Affection, <hi>and favoriſe this</hi> alliance <hi>with thy</hi> aſſiſtance. <hi>I am but too certain of her</hi> Parent's <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and</hi> that <hi>they are no leſs willing to make mee their</hi> Son-in-law, <hi>than I deſire to have their</hi> Daughter <hi>to</hi> Wife.</p>
               <p>Then, after ſome other diſcourſe, conceiving that nothing hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from beeing beloved by <hi>Amiclea,</hi> but the <hi>Paſſion</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed her for <hi>Iphigenes, Liante</hi> continued his ſupplication to him to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:51476:165"/> deprive her of all <hi>Hope</hi> of injoying him, that ſhee might likewiſe loſe the <hi>deſire,</hi> flattering his imagination <hi>that</hi> thereby her <hi>Love,</hi> having no more wings to raiſe it ſelf, would doubtleſs fall to the ground; the onely means of curing that <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> in her <hi>Fancy,</hi> and to pluck the <hi>Thorns</hi> out of her <hi>Heart,</hi> beeing to put the <hi>Roſe</hi> out of her <hi>reach.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging <hi>that</hi> to perſwade her to divert her thoughts another way, and fix them upon a <hi>ſubject</hi> to whom ſhee might eaſily and juſtly pretend, hee had a thouſand reaſons, and wanted no inventions to lend him merits that hee poſſeſſed not, and convey them into the belief of that <hi>Lady.</hi> That if, by his mediation, hee purchaſed her <hi>Affection,</hi> hee would eſteem that <hi>favour</hi> above the benefit of his <hi>Life</hi> (for which hee remained his debter) in regard <hi>Life</hi> would be loathſome to him, if hee could procure no admittance into <hi>Amiclea's</hi> Heart.</p>
               <p>Imagine you into what extremities <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſaw himſelf reduced, not beeing able handſomly to refuſe ſerving <hi>Liante</hi> in an occaſion that hee dreaded the moſt, and which was moſt deſtructive to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Having remained long time in this perplexity, as motionleſs as if hee had ſeen a <hi>Meduſa,</hi> or been ſtunn'd with ſome violent blow, at length recollecting his <hi>Spirits,</hi> and like <hi>Anteus,</hi> receiving vigour from his <hi>fall,</hi> hee gave his voyce paſſage to pronounce theſe words.</p>

                     <hi>Liante,</hi> if you knew the harm and injury you do mee, you would have ſome compaſſion of my ſuffering, and acknowledge that you condemne mee to a puniſhment much leſs ſupportable than <hi>Death,</hi> by intreating mee to ſerve you in this occurrence. I know you will ſay, that the triall of a <hi>Friend</hi> is in difficult matters, and time of need; But if wee ought to love another, by the modell of that <hi>Love</hi> which wee owe to our ſelves, it followe's neceſſarily that our own intereſt ought to have the precedence, according to the order of the moſt perfect <hi>Charity.</hi> It is not yet time for you to know the injury I receive thereby, nor the extream dammage and hinderance it will bee to your <hi>Fortune,</hi> which I intended to raiſe above all other <hi>Grandeurs</hi> in <hi>Polonia,</hi> except the <hi>Royall</hi> Dignity. I ſee plainly that it is the luſter of ſome pleaſures, and vain pretenſions, that make's you precipitate your ſelf from this Pinacle, and ſeek your fall, where you thought to <hi>raiſe</hi> your ſelf. Queſtionleſs I ſhall bee a <hi>Caſſandra</hi> to you, and tell you divers truths, but you will believe none. Well, <hi>Liante,</hi> perchance my <hi>Death</hi> will open your Eyes, and then (by a <hi>remorſe</hi> too late and out of ſeaſon) you will regret that you had cauſed <hi>it</hi> to one, who prepared for you the happieſt <hi>Life</hi> that your
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51476:165"/> imagination could fathome. Nevertheleſs I will drink this <hi>Cup</hi> of bitterneſs, which you preſent mee, and although it bee to mee a <hi>poyſon</hi> beyond remedy, I will ſwallow it, to ſhew the <hi>force</hi> of my <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of my <hi>Love,</hi> to a Man, who (I believed) could not be capable of <hi>ingatitude.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Liante</hi> thinking hee had diſcovered all the <hi>ſecret,</hi> 
                  <q>ſaid; <hi>Brother,</hi> have I caught you? I knew this <hi>ſtraining</hi> would ſo <hi>torture</hi> you, that in deſpight of your <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> I ſhould at length wring out of your own <hi>Mouth</hi> the <hi>verity,</hi> which you hid in the bottome of your <hi>Heart.</hi> You love <hi>Amiclea</hi> then, for whom you counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited ſo much coldneſs and indifference; and, thruſting <hi>Time</hi> back by the ſhoulders expecting the concluſion of the <hi>Peace,</hi> you would amuſe mee in the interim with promiſes of imaginary <hi>dignities,</hi> like thoſe who give Children <hi>Cherries</hi> with certain mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> that make them ſhew as big as <hi>Apples:</hi> To the end at the ſame time you may kill two <hi>Birds</hi> with one <hi>bolt,</hi> and by breaking your <hi>Faith</hi> to the <hi>Siſter</hi> deprive the <hi>Brother</hi> of a <hi>Love,</hi> which hee preferr's before his <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At length after a tedious Conference to this effect, <hi>Liante</hi> beeing perſwaded by the ſuggeſtions of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> that the fair <hi>Palatine</hi> was the onely obſtacle of his pretentions, in a diſcontented humour quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the room, leaving <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with ſuch a tempeſt in his thoughts, as you may fancy, <hi>Love, Deſpight, Shame, Choller, Deſpair,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> (which then tormented him all together) by their impetuous blaſts were able to raiſe in a <hi>Lover's</hi> minde. Yet beeing reſolved to ſuffer all extremities, rather than breake abſolutely with <hi>Liante,</hi> hee ſearched among his thoughts for Excuſes, and ſome Reaſons to pardon his ingratitude. And after a thouſand Muſings, and as many extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Diſcourſes, Alas! ſaid hee to himſelf; <hi>It is thou (I phigenes) who art</hi> cauſe <hi>of thy own miſchief, yet thou accuſeſt the</hi> innocent, <hi>thou hidest his</hi> Eyes <hi>and complaineſt if hee hurt thee. Reſtore, reſtore his</hi> ſight <hi>by diſcovering to him what thou art, and then thou wilt finde</hi> that <hi>as the</hi> ſhadowes <hi>of the</hi> Night <hi>fly from the</hi> Preſence <hi>of the</hi> Sun, <hi>So all his</hi> Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions <hi>will vaniſh when thou ſhalt let him ſee the cleer</hi> Day <hi>of</hi> Truth.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſometimes injuring <hi>Liante,</hi> ſometimes crying him mercy, ſometimes accuſing, ſometimes excuſing him, digeſted that <hi>bitterneſs</hi> with ſuch anguiſh, that (if a timely ſhower of tears had not wetted the Wings of his agitated Spirits, benum'd his <hi>Senſes,</hi> and at laſt cloſed his <hi>Eyes</hi>) hee was in danger of falling into a <hi>Freneſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:51476:166"/>
               <p>Mean time <hi>Liante</hi> neglected no indeavours to get <hi>Iphigenes</hi> out of the <hi>City,</hi> judging that in reſpect Hee had entred upon his <hi>Word,</hi> his <hi>Honour</hi> was ingaged to remit him in the ſame condition as hee took him: Beſides, the intereſt of his <hi>Love</hi> inſtigated him ſhrewdly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite that enterpriſe, imagining, as a <hi>Loadſtone</hi> loſeth it's faculty of attracting iron in the preſence of a <hi>Diamond,</hi> that hee ſhould never be able to draw the <hi>Affections</hi> of <hi>Amielea</hi> to him, as long as her Eyes had that beautifull <hi>Palatine</hi> to contemplate. But as it is no leſs eaſie to bee caught in a ſnare, than hard to get looſe; So in the <hi>Warres</hi> a Man may bee ſoon made <hi>priſoner,</hi> but not ſo ſodainly inlarged. <hi>Liante</hi> to acquire the <hi>glory</hi> of that <hi>Prize,</hi> had conducted that <hi>intelligence</hi> without communicating it to the <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Minſee</hi> and <hi>Troc:</hi> But to make <hi>Iphigenes</hi> eſcape without advertiſing them, had been to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Perſon to a ſhamefull puniſhment, and declare himſelf an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> and a <hi>Traitour</hi> to the <hi>publick</hi> good: So that hee knew not what to reſolve. On the other ſide, the <hi>Paſſion</hi> hee ſuffered for <hi>Amiclea</hi> never gave his <hi>Mind</hi> any truce: yet to marry one that loved him not, in that great Averſion and Perplexity of <hi>Spirit,</hi> (th' <hi>Idea</hi> of another <hi>Object</hi> having wholly prepoſſeſſ'd her thoughts) he ſaw as little likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as contentment.</p>
               <p>In this anxiety hee went to tell <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that without his Counſell hee could not finde a thred to lead him out of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had ingaged himſelf by entring into <hi>Minſce. Iphigenes,</hi> who had no deſire to go out, was glad to take this advantage of <hi>Liante,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That comming in upon his word, hee thought the Gates ſhould be open for him when hee pleaſed.</hi> And, <hi>Liante</hi> having told him the difficulties and obſtacles hee found in procuring his inlargement, hee continued; <q>See what a great <hi>Name</hi> you have in appearance among the <hi>Rebells,</hi> and how little <hi>Power</hi> in effect. It is not ſo with mee in the <hi>King's</hi> Party; For, I am ſo confident of His <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> goodneſs, that hee will receive you graciouſly, and when I ſhall have acquainted him with the motives of your. <hi>Deſpair,</hi> that hee will re-eſtabliſh you in deſpight of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> in your Eſtate, and confer ſuch Dignities upon you as you can never hope to gaine by this <hi>Rebellion.</hi> And if you will decline thoſe thoughts of <hi>Marriage</hi> with <hi>Amiclea</hi> (which are as ruinous to you as grievous to mee, for Reaſons which it is not yet time to tell you,) Let mee alone with the conduct of your <hi>Fortune,</hi> and aſſure your ſelf, that I will not onely repair the Breaches of it, but raiſe it to ſuch an height, that your deſires will ſcarce be able toto reach it.</q>

                  <hi>Paſſion</hi> is a deceiving <hi>Medium,</hi> through which wee cannot rightly diſcern the ſincerity of any thing. <hi>Liante</hi> beeing prepoſſeſſed with a falſe ſuſpicion and prejudice againſt <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> thought all his Poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Promiſes but onely inventions to deceive him; eſpecially in regard they tended to make him break thoſe <hi>Bonds,</hi> which hee eſteemed above all <hi>Honours</hi> or <hi>Libertie:</hi> And not conceiving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſhould have ſuch repugnancy to his <hi>Marriage,</hi> hee reſolved to play the <hi>Adder,</hi> ſtopping his Ears to that wiſe <hi>Charmer,</hi> and preſs all he could his <hi>Alliance</hi> with <hi>Amiclea.</hi>

                  <q>Whereupon hee anſwered, <hi>That</hi> hee was not ſo little judicious, as to leave a certainty for an uncertainty, and a <hi>Prey</hi> which hee had already in his Hands, to follow a new <hi>Sent;</hi> No, hee was too well skill'd in hunting to take the <hi>Change.

               <p>This hurried the thoughts of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> beyond the bounds of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> ſeeing the obſtinancy of that inflexible <hi>Courage:</hi> yet hee moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his paſſion a little, not without letting appear ſome <hi>ſparkles</hi> of his inward <hi>fire</hi> by theſe words. <q>You cannot reſtore me my <hi>Liberty,</hi> &amp; you will marry <hi>Amiclea</hi> againſt my <hi>Will.</hi> Well, <hi>Liante,</hi> know that being more powerfull than you in all reſpects, I can take again my <hi>Liberty</hi> when I pleaſe, and hinder you from having <hi>Amiclea</hi> to Wife.

Therefore I beſeech you to quit the <hi>deſire</hi> of a perſon, who cannot lawfully bee your's, and apply your <hi>Heart</hi> to him, whom your <hi>Parents</hi> have deſigned you, and who ſo perfectly honour you, that I believe nothing can bee added to the greatneſs of his <hi>affection.</hi> I am incited to make you this requeſt, by the antient <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which from my <hi>infancy</hi> I have contracted with <hi>Liante,</hi> the <hi>ſelicity</hi> I wiſh you and (if I may dare to make this addition) the <hi>deſire</hi> I have of moderating my reſtraint.</q>

               <p>Seigneur Palatine (<hi>anſwered</hi> Amiclea,) <hi>you are a better</hi> Friend <hi>than faithfull</hi> Lover; <hi>I have told you ſo many times that it is as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for mee to lodge</hi> Liante <hi>in my</hi> Heart, <hi>as diſplace you; you continue deaf to my Complaints, yet you would have mee be exorable to his; you are too blame to condemn mee for a fault which you authorize in your ſelf, and perſwade mee by your</hi> words <hi>what your</hi> Example <hi>diſſwade's. For, if you will not receive mee into your</hi> Affection, <hi>for ſome weak reaſons wherewith you oppoſe my importunities, why ſhould not I defend my ſelf from his</hi> alliance <hi>for many good and powerfull ones, which I have ſo often inculcated to you?

He hath often told me that his</hi> Life <hi>depended ſo upon the poſſeſſion of me, that without it he ſhould</hi> die; <hi>but I do ſo abhor him ſince I have diſcovered his</hi> humour, <hi>that I will rather marry a</hi> Grave <hi>than ingage my Faith to</hi> him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſaid <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſince hee love's you ſo exceſſively, you cannot without ingratitude do leſs than give him your <hi>Heart</hi> in exchange for his, which hee hath remitted into your <hi>hands.</hi> I cannot give an <hi>Heart</hi> that is not mine, anſwered <hi>Amiclea,</hi> and (what <hi>Friendſhip</hi> ſoever there is betwixt you) take that from <hi>you</hi> which is your's by my <hi>Free-gift,</hi> to give it him; it is eaſier for mee to return him his own, which I never entertain'd though he offered it often; or at leaſt intreate him to take it again, and beſtow it on ſome other <hi>Subject</hi> more fit than I am to ſupport his <hi>Tyrannies.</hi> You know (replyed <hi>Iphigenes</hi>) that the Law of <hi>Gentlemen</hi> permit's not any generous <hi>Spirits</hi> to play the ſupplanters to their <hi>Friends,</hi> and that <hi>Liante</hi> beeing the firſt pretender to your Service, I may not imbrace that Deſigne untill hee hath quitted it, or that you have quite broken with him.</q>

                  <q>As for the <hi>firſt</hi> (ſaid <hi>Amiclea,</hi>) it depend's on him, and I know not (hee is ſo obſtinate in his own miſchief) whether hee will let go that which hee hold's but by imagination; The <hi>ſecond</hi> is fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on for my part: For, I have deſired him ſo many times not to importune mee any more with his <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Sighs,</hi> that I know
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51476:171"/> not what pleaſure hee take's to Shipwrack his Vowes ſo often againſt a Rock that laugh's at his Diſaſters. In a word, whatſoever You can ſay or Hee do, I will never bee his in <hi>Body</hi> nor <hi>Minde.</hi> I have not ſo little courage, but that I know the way to ſet a period to my <hi>Life,</hi> when I ſhall perceive it worſe than a thouſand <hi>Deaths.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After divers other Speeches to the ſame effect, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> let mee intreat you to quit that reſolution ſo cruell to him, and ſo unpleaſing to mee; Unpleaſing to mee, out of the <hi>ſorrow</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, becauſe I cannot anſwer your <hi>Affection</hi> as I would: And cruell to him, becauſe I know if this newes come's to his Ears, it will bee the meſſage of <hi>Death.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Imagine you with what perplexities the afflicted <hi>Liante</hi> heard from the Mouth of his Mortall <hi>Goddeſs</hi> the ſentence of his condemnation: with what reproches did hee not charge her <hi>Severity</hi> in his <hi>Minde,</hi> yet hee loved her ne're the leſs; on the contrary her <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> like two whet-ſtones ſharpened his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and rendered it more fervent. At length beeing no longer able to ſuſtein the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his diſtemper contrary to the promiſe hee had made <hi>Iphigenes</hi> not to appear, hee left his <hi>Poſt</hi> in fury, and (his <hi>Eyes</hi> overflowed with <hi>Teares,</hi> and his <hi>Heart</hi> ſwell'd with <hi>Sobb's</hi>) hee caſt himſelf at <hi>Amiclea's</hi> feet, at the ſame inſtant as ſhee had taken <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Hand and was raiſing it to to her <hi>Lips.</hi> This Action with the diſcourſe hee heard had almoſt tranſported him beyond the bounds of reſpect: At laſt having obtained ſome truce of his <hi>Paſsion,</hi> hee disburthened his <hi>mind</hi> in theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>Amiclea</hi> (although ſhee had been advertiſed of his beeing hid in the room,) was however ſo troubled at his preſence, and ſo frighted to ſee him in that deſperate poſture, that her <hi>voyce</hi> cleaving to the Palate of her <hi>Mouth,</hi> ſhee was not able to frame an anſwer. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> fearing, leſt ſhee refuſing to take that Weapon, <hi>Liante's</hi> fury might tranſport him to plunge it in his own boſome, preſently ſeized upon his Arm, to wreſt that murtherous blade out of his hand. <hi>Liante</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iphigenes</hi> diſarming him, <hi>If that</hi> Lady (ſaid hee, looking on <hi>Amiclea</hi> with an <hi>Eye</hi> full of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Anger) hath not the courage to advance the tearm of my miſerable</hi> Life, <hi>cut thou (if thou haſt ever loved mee) the</hi> Thred <hi>of my</hi> Dayes; <hi>and ſince thou haſt robbed mee of my</hi> Heart, <hi>where all my</hi> hopes <hi>were ſeated, make an</hi> End <hi>of thy Felony by Ending Mee.</hi>

               <p>Gueſs you if theſe furious <hi>words</hi> which the extremity of <hi>griefe</hi> forced out of <hi>Liante's</hi> Mouth, were not ſufficient to draw tears from the tender <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Eyes. <hi>Amiclea</hi> beeing recovered of her amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to appeaſe the <hi>fury</hi> of that mad <hi>Lover,</hi> reſolved to uſe him more gently, and, with a more pleaſing tone, ſhew him how much hee was too blame in ſuffering himſelf to be ſo tranſported with <hi>Paſſion:</hi> But as <hi>Medicines</hi> are uſeleſs to thoſe whoſe Diſeaſes are incurable, or who are not diſpoſed to receive them: So <hi>Despair</hi> had ſo ſtopt us all the advenues of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in <hi>Liante's</hi> Soul, that hee thought there was no other way but through the Gate of <hi>Death,</hi> to get out of his inconſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>torment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould bee too tedious if I ſtood to relate the diverſe arguments, whereby <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Amiclea</hi> indeavoured to appeaſe the frantick tranſportments of his <hi>Minde.</hi> But ſometimes vomiting <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> againſt <hi>Heaven;</hi> Sometimes tearing the <hi>Earth</hi> with <hi>Execrations;</hi> Sometimes curſing <hi>himſelf;</hi> Sometimes quarrelling with <hi>Providence;</hi> Sometimes accuſing <hi>Amiclea,</hi> and then craving her <hi>Pardon;</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reviling <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> then condemning his own raſh <hi>Judgement,</hi> Hee did and ſaid ſuch things as are more fit to bee wrapped up in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than diſplayed upon this Paper; and which made evidently appear <hi>that</hi> if <hi>Anger</hi> bee a ſhort <hi>Fury, Love</hi> is a pure <hi>Folly.</hi> At length having received from <hi>Amiclea</hi> no word of conſolation that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:51476:172"/> his <hi>Hope</hi> in that tempeſt of <hi>Rage</hi> that aſſailed his thoughts, after no mean contention with <hi>Himſelf,</hi> hee went out of the Chamber, in the ſame manner as an inraged <hi>Bull</hi> breake's through the Rankes of thoſe that ſee him baited, invoking <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to aſſiſt him in a <hi>Revenge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Liante's</hi> departure <hi>Amiclea</hi> was called away by her Governeſs, who attended her in the next room; <hi>Iphigenes</hi> beeing left alone had his thoughts ſo divided betwixt the intereſts of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> that his pains, exceeding the bounds of any expreſſion, caſt him into a languiſhing indiſpoſition, which within few dayes render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo feeble, that hee was inforced to confine his diſtreſſed body to his Bed: where hee appeared with ſuch advantage, that his <hi>ſickneſs</hi> ſeemed to have caſt him down, the more to raiſe the luſtre of his <hi>Beauty;</hi> which beeing then betwixt <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> raviſhed thoſe <hi>Souls</hi> that had not rendered themſelves before to <hi>Paſſion.</hi> The <hi>Ladies</hi> (who were as if they had been chained to his Bed-ſtead) ſtrove to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy each other in inventing remedies for his <hi>Body,</hi> and divertiſements for his <hi>Minde:</hi> And the <hi>Palatines,</hi> both of <hi>Minſce</hi> and <hi>Troc,</hi> came fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to viſit him, promiſing to give him all the <hi>contentments</hi> hee could deſire of their <hi>Courteſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mean time <hi>Liante</hi> gaping ſtill after his <hi>Prey,</hi> reſolved to have <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> though againſt her <hi>Will,</hi> not to give himſelf the Lie; founding his determination upon this belief, that <hi>Time</hi> would bring all things to perfection, and that which was <hi>forc't</hi> in the <hi>beginning,</hi> might bee made <hi>willing</hi> in the <hi>End.</hi> Her <hi>Father</hi> had already given him his <hi>word,</hi> and was much diſpleaſed that the obſtinacy of his <hi>Daughter</hi> ſhould oppoſe his <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> By <hi>Polemander's</hi> means he gained likewiſe the <hi>Mother's</hi> conſent, who thinking him an advantageous <hi>Match</hi> for her <hi>Daughter,</hi> made no account of her contradiction. The <hi>Contract</hi> was agreed on without <hi>Amiclea's</hi> knowledge, but beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all the paſſages by <hi>Oloria</hi> (whom <hi>Deſpair</hi> had almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted) ſhee comforted her with this aſſurance, <hi>that</hi> ſhee would never conſent to marry <hi>Liante,</hi> nor any other untill <hi>Shee</hi> were provided; which ſomewhat qualified her jealous <hi>Siſter's</hi> pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amiclea</hi> was not long before ſhee gave <hi>Iphigenes</hi> notice of thoſe proceedings, which gave ſo furious an aſſault to his debilitated <hi>Heart,</hi> that increaſing the violence of his <hi>Feaver,</hi> the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> began to diſtruſt his <hi>Recovery.</hi> This newes was preſently noiſed in the <hi>Camp,</hi> and thence carried to the <hi>Court;</hi> and that which the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> moſt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51476:172"/> feared (which was a <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> that hee had been poyſoned by them) was the firſt impreſſion His <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> minde received. Whereupon hee ſent them <hi>Letters,</hi> more bloody than <hi>Tamberlan's</hi> Crimſon <hi>Flag;</hi> To which they returned their Excuſes and Proteſtations of innocence; But <hi>Poyſon</hi> is not purged by <hi>Oaths,</hi> and thoſe who are ſo abominable as to praciſe ſuch baſeneſs, make no great ſcruple of beeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> preſently diſpatched his own <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and <hi>Surgeons</hi> with command to attend the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> They were very civilly received by the beſieged <hi>Party,</hi> as had already been <hi>thoſe</hi> whom the <hi>Generall</hi> and <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had ſent from the <hi>Camp. Boleſlaüs,</hi> who was touched with a more then <hi>Fatherly</hi> tenderneſs for his dear <hi>Foſter-Child,</hi> found means to ſlip himſelf in amongſt the <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> feining that hee was an <hi>Apothecary.</hi> The <hi>Phyſitians</hi> in their Conſultations found that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Body was not <hi>priſoned,</hi> but their <hi>Learning</hi> did not reach ſo far as to read the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of his <hi>Minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They being retired, when <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> appeared before the <hi>Patient's</hi> Eyes, already clouded in the ſhade of <hi>Death,</hi> they received ſome <hi>vigour;</hi> and his <hi>Spirits</hi> as it were, wakening out of the ſlumber wherewith <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Mellancholly</hi> had oppreſſed them, his <hi>Tongue</hi> looſened it ſelf to utter with a faint and almoſt dying voyce theſe words. <hi>Father, I bleſs the</hi> Heavens <hi>who have ſent you hither (as a Tutelary</hi> Angell) <hi>to render mee the laſt</hi> devoirs <hi>as of your officious</hi> Piety <hi>I have received the first; your</hi> Arms <hi>which have heretofore ſerved mee as a</hi> Cradle, <hi>muſt ſhortly do mee the office of a</hi> Biere; <hi>for, I can no longer ſupport the</hi> Sorrow <hi>that deſtroye's me. I have nothing elſe to recommend to you but the</hi> Care <hi>of my</hi> Honour, <hi>which I have alwayes maintain'd inviolable in deſpight of thoſe miſchiefs that have perſecuted mee, Bee ſure that the</hi> Earth <hi>may cover my</hi> Secret <hi>with my</hi> Body, <hi>ſince I have choſen to</hi> die <hi>rather than diſcloſe it. Since that I</hi> die <hi>before the time which your</hi> Prudence <hi>had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to diſcover it, I applaud the</hi> Providence <hi>of him under whoſe</hi> will <hi>run all the</hi> Moments <hi>of our</hi> Life. <hi>For, to ſurvive the loſs of</hi> Liante's <hi>Friendſhip, is a thing which I cannot do if I would, and which I will not do though I could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Tears, Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> ſtopped the paſſage of his <hi>voyce,</hi> and hee fell into a <hi>Traunce,</hi> out of which it coſt ſome time to recover him. Imagine you how <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> was afflicted ſeeing him in ſo great Extremities, and knowing ſo little whence proceeded this indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At length having ſettled his dear <hi>Nurſling</hi> in a little better
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51476:173"/> temper as well of <hi>Bodie</hi> as <hi>Minde,</hi> and deſiring him to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ground of his Diſeaſe: <hi>Father</hi> (ſaid Iphigenes) <hi>Let mee</hi> die <hi>in ſilence, and do you onely have a care of that</hi> Honour <hi>after my</hi> Death, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you have been ſo jealous during my</hi> Life.</p>
               <p>The diſcreet old <hi>Man</hi> knowing with whom hee was to deale, and that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> loved not to bee preſs't, feined to reſolve to <hi>die</hi> with him, as not having the <hi>Heart</hi> to behold the <hi>Day</hi> after the loſs of him, whoſe conſideration made him love its <hi>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> moved with <hi>Pitty</hi> at the old <hi>Man's</hi> tenderneſs, to hinder him from <hi>dying,</hi> ſeemed to re-affect the deſire of <hi>Living;</hi> and, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load his <hi>Heart</hi> of that ſad burthen which oppreſs't it, hee took the pains to relate him every particular that had paſſed ſince his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how hee had voluntarily made himſelf bee taken, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. By which Diſcourſe <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> ſeeing cleer to the bottom of his <hi>Soul,</hi> and reading there the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of his diſtemper: <hi>Take courage</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>we ſhall not</hi> die <hi>of this ſickneſs, if wee will be ruled by good advice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father</hi> (anſwered <hi>Iphigenes) when things are deſperate, it is no time to conſult but to ſuffer: It will be eaſier and better for mee to</hi> die, <hi>ſince I am already ſo neer it, than re-enter into a thouſand</hi> Deaths <hi>by recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my</hi> Health. <hi>Liante's</hi> Heart <hi>beeing</hi> dead <hi>to mee, I have nothing more to do in this mortall</hi> Life. After <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> had uſed diverſe arguments to perſwade <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to baniſh the ingratefull <hi>Liante</hi> out of his <hi>thoughts,</hi> as unworthy of the favour of his <hi>Affection,</hi> Hee anſwered, <q>Father, do not increaſe my torment with vilifying <hi>him</hi> whom my <hi>Soul</hi> honoureth; For, notwithſtanding all your allegations and his unkinde uſage, I cannot divert the inclinations of my <hi>Heart,</hi> nor change the reſolution of <hi>Loving</hi> him, but by loſing my <hi>Life.</hi> Therefore if you love mee (as I have no reaſon to doubt) and if you will oblige mee to love you yet more (if it bee poſſible) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you go without delay to him, and conjure <hi>him</hi> not to flie from <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who would ſeeke and run after <hi>him,</hi> if his Sickneſs did not fetter him. Tell <hi>him</hi> that if I had contracted with <hi>him</hi> but a common acquaintance, <hi>Civility</hi> would oblige him to viſit mee, much more ſince <hi>hee</hi> is <hi>cauſe</hi> of this <hi>extremity,</hi> whereunto I am reduced.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51476:173"/> 
                     <hi>that</hi> hee would vouchſafe onely to ſee mee, and cloſe my <hi>Eyes,</hi> that, with the <hi>favour</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> I may likewiſe <hi>die</hi> in <hi>his.</hi> Hereunto I pray, <hi>good Father,</hi> ſtudy no Excuſes nor Replyes, if you deſire that I ſhould <hi>Live.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> who knew the <hi>Palatine's</hi> humour, promiſed a punctuall performance of his commands, adding for his comfort, that by the long experience hee had of <hi>Liante's</hi> Diſpoſition, hee doubted not to render him more flexible and ſenſible of his <hi>torment.</hi> And then having dexterouſly taken his time, <hi>Dear Child</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>ſince you have ſo changed into</hi> Nature <hi>this</hi> Love, <hi>that it is become an</hi> accident <hi>inſeparable to your</hi> Beeing, <hi>by undertaking to preſerve your</hi> Life, <hi>I will alſo aym at the preſervation of your</hi> affection; <hi>and ſince I finde you cannot</hi> live <hi>content without</hi> Liante, <hi>I muſt uſe ſome invention to reduce that</hi> Heart <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At theſe words you would have thought <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had been raiſed again out of the <hi>Grave;</hi> or at leaſt that hee reſembled a dainty <hi>Flower</hi> too much beaten with the <hi>Sun's</hi> Rayes, which re-take's new <hi>vigour</hi> by the coolneſs of the <hi>Dew.</hi> In a word, <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was a <hi>Woman,</hi> and among ſo many <hi>Heroick</hi> vertues which ſhee poſſeſſ't, the <hi>Naturall</hi> inclination of that <hi>Sex</hi> to curioſity could not bee extinguiſhed in Her.</p>
               <p>The ſubtle <hi>Senior</hi> perceiving it, made himſelf bee intreated a while; at length, after many circumſtances, hee ſaid, <hi>Child, it is no time to ſpare when a</hi> Man <hi>is come to the laſt penny of his ſtock. The laſt thing wee muſt do in this</hi> World <hi>is to</hi> die; <hi>to prevent that</hi> Check, <hi>and prolong that</hi> fatall <hi>hour, nothing ought to be left unattempted. When you would have diſcovered your ſelf to</hi> Liante <hi>in the Forreſt of</hi> Plocens, <hi>you were preſſed onely with a</hi> temptation; <hi>Now you are conſtrained by</hi> neceſſity. <hi>You will ſay</hi> that <hi>the remedy is not yet in</hi> ſeaſon, <hi>and that it will be the ruine of your</hi> Fortunes: <hi>If you</hi> die, <hi>your</hi> Fortunes <hi>will be otherwiſe loſt; after</hi> Death, <hi>Phyſick is of no uſe.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:51476:174"/> obſtacles you know of to the pretenſions, which hee believ's you have for</hi> Amiclea. <hi>In ſumme, I will manage this diſcovery with ſuch circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that <hi>there can arrive no dammage to you; For, in ſparing you the</hi> ſhame <hi>of telling it (the onely</hi> Subject <hi>of all your</hi> Sorrow) <hi>I will leave you in the</hi> power <hi>of denying that</hi> truth, <hi>and rendring ridiculous thoſe that ſhould offer to mention it.

               <p>All this Diſcourſe was ſo many words of <hi>Life</hi> to the diſtreſſed <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> and, if an <hi>Angell</hi> had ſpoken to him, hee could not have heard him with more joy and attention than hee did <hi>Boleſlaüs.</hi> Then (prick't with curioſity) ſaying, <hi>But how?</hi> The old Man ſtop't his Mouth with this anſwer: <hi>A Man muſt never ſay,</hi> I will doe this, <hi>or</hi> I will ſay that, <hi>and</hi> in ſuch a manner I will conduct my Deſign <hi>by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the incertainty of</hi> Events; <hi>and the obſcurities wherein the</hi> Future <hi>is involved; But when things have had a good iſſue, one may ſay,</hi> I have done this, <hi>and</hi> my deſigne ſucceeded thus. <hi>I will do nothing but what you ſhall know, yet give mee a little</hi> liberty, <hi>and permit that in imitation of most diſcreet</hi> People, <hi>I may do ſomewhat before I speak.

               </p>
               <p>This ſaid, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> went to put in execution his Deſign, which ſucceeded to his wiſh; but not without much trouble, many ſubtile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and at length a full relation from beginning to end of <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> Birth and Education, as hath already been deſcribed; whereby hee made <hi>Liante</hi> ſee as clear as the <hi>Day</hi> the reaſons that had retarded <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in the diſcovery of that <hi>Miracle,</hi> his deſigne to declare it firſt to the <hi>King,</hi> that His <hi>Majesty</hi> might ſee how falſe and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent had been the <hi>Calumny</hi> of his <hi>Enviers,</hi> and (beeing re-eſtabliſhed in his favour) the reſolution hee had to inveſt <hi>Liante</hi> in the poſſeſſion

               </p>
               <p>This tranſported <hi>Liante</hi> with ſuch aſtoniſhment for a while, that hee knew not whether hee was a ſleep or waking; yet the ſerious deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the grave <hi>Boleſlaüs,</hi> made him give credit to this <hi>Story,</hi> and this beliefe was perfectly confirmed, when hee repaſſed through his <hi>Memory</hi> all the tokens of <hi>Love</hi> rather than <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> that hee had remarked in <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> his carriage to him in his <hi>Infancy,</hi> his chaſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments at the <hi>Court,</hi> his continuall contempt of <hi>Women,</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Beauty,</hi> his paſſionate expreſſions of <hi>affection</hi> to him in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Plocens,</hi> while the one acted <hi>Serife,</hi> the other <hi>Almeria;</hi> beſides, divers other <hi>Careſſes, Wiſhes, Sighs, Languors,</hi> and ſuch like demeanours, the <hi>ſparkles</hi> of that <hi>Fire</hi> which can as little bee concealed as avoided.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Liante,</hi> what glory after ſo many pains! He that hath long been kept in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> coming on a ſodain into the <hi>Sun</hi> is in a manner blind, the <hi>Light,</hi> which make's every one elſe ſee, depriving him of <hi>ſight:</hi> So <hi>Liante,</hi> though hee held as true as <hi>Oracles,</hi> all that <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> had told him, yet hee remained as voyd of Speech and Motion as one that's incredulous or ſtupid. The entrance of his <hi>Heart</hi> was too narrow to let in at once the throng of <hi>affections,</hi> that thruſt and crowded to bee introduced; the multitude of <hi>thoughts</hi> quelled him; the <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> propoſed to him by that <hi>Party</hi> were above his <hi>Ambition,</hi> and beyond his <hi>Hopes;</hi> his own <hi>Patrimony,</hi> uſurped by <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> ſeemed nothing to him; But above all, the ſo many attractive <hi>Charms,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Nature</hi> had inriched <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Face, was the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> that tranſported him. Adding thereunto ſo many rare vertues, ſo many ſingular qualities, ſuch <hi>Courage, &amp; Valour,</hi> which <hi>Dexterity</hi> in all generous exerciſes, and chiefly ſuch exemplary <hi>Piety,</hi> as rendered him the delight of all thoſe that accoſted him, filled him with the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> begat him an high renown, with the <hi>King's</hi> favour; which doubtleſs would bee redoubled at the diſcovery of this Marvell; Oh <hi>Liante,</hi> what tranſportments? Then reflecting his conſideration upon himſelf, hee could not imagine that hee had merit enough to oblige <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to ſo conſtant a <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> as that, which hee had alwayes expreſſed towards him, loving him from the tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his years with ſuch ſweetneſs and cordiality; after this, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his <hi>Memory</hi> how compaſſionately in all his troubles hee bare a ſhare of his <hi>ſorrowes;</hi> how hee alwayes maintained his cauſe againſt

               </p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Liante's</hi> brain was agitated with a thouſand ſuch imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> reading the convulſions of his <hi>Mind</hi> by the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his <hi>Face,</hi> knew not however in what manner hee reſented what hee had told him, and whether hee conceived it right or wrong, (whereon depended his <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> and, what was yet more dear, the contentment or ruine of <hi>Iphigenes</hi>) untill <hi>Liante</hi> breaking the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his long amazement thus began; <hi>Friend, I am like a Glaſs or Bottle with a narrow mouth, which being too full of liquor cannot diſcharge itſelf.

                  <hi>If you ſtay till you are killed by one that love's you more than himſelf, you will live to a fair Age</hi> (ſaid Boleſlaus) <hi>his deſire is to ſee you</hi> Live <hi>contented, not</hi> Die <hi>with displeaſure; and aſſure your ſelf that as his</hi> Love <hi>was alwayes greater than your</hi> Injuries, <hi>ſo your</hi> Tranſgreſſions <hi>are leſs than his</hi> Clemency.</p>
               <p>The variety of <hi>thoughts</hi> that muſtered in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> minde, whileſt <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> was carrying this Meſſage (whoſe report was the ſentence of his <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death</hi>) I muſt leave to your imaginations; Neither am I able to relate the Anxieties of <hi>Liante's</hi> minde, whileſt that truſty <hi>Agent</hi> flew

               </p>
               <p>At which Narration <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ready to expire with grief, ſaid; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would to</hi> God <hi>my</hi> Death <hi>had preceded this</hi> newes; <hi>Oh! why did not I deſcend alive into my Grave?</hi> Hereat <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> clearing the clouds of his Countenance, and burſting into a laughter, ſaid, <hi>I told you thus only to try your conſtancy; take courage, the</hi> Victory <hi>is our's; I bring you</hi> Liante <hi>more gentle than a</hi> Lamb, <hi>he com's to preſent his</hi> throat <hi>to your</hi> hand <hi>that you may</hi> Sacrifice <hi>him to your</hi> Revenge. <hi>He believe's all that I have told; him onely the</hi> deſpair <hi>of obtaining pardon for his</hi> ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude <hi>to you, hindering him from coming to demand it in perſon, he hath made me his</hi> Ambaſſadour. Then having related every particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage betwixt him and <hi>Liante,</hi> and diſpoſed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to receive him, He preſently went to conduct him into the <hi>Priſoner's</hi> Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> was ſo ſenſible of having diſobliged ſo admirable a conſtancy as that of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that hee approacht his Bed with no leſs throbbing of <hi>Heart</hi> and confuſion of <hi>thoughts,</hi> than if hee had been going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the puniſhment of ſome haynous <hi>Crime:</hi> And <hi>ſhame</hi> raiſed tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults not much leſs diſorderly in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> minde, ſeeing himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to acknowledge what he had ſo long kept from the <hi>World's</hi> notice.</p>
               <p>Hee that had beheld the <hi>penctentiall</hi> tears of the one, and the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest</hi> bluſhes of the other, would have thought hee had ſeen red <hi>Roſes</hi> impearled with the <hi>dew</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> I had rather confeſs my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance than imbark my ſelf in the relation of <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which muſt bee conſigned to <hi>Silence,</hi> ſince hee that would expreſs their mutuall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions muſt bee transformed into the Reſentments of their <hi>Souls.</hi> Thoſe two Hearts opened themſelves ſo perfectly to each other in the preſence of the <hi>Old Man,</hi> Depoſitary of all their thoughts, that there remained nothing that might oppoſe the perfection of their chaſte <hi>Love.</hi> There full reparations were made by <hi>Liante,</hi> and his Excuſes received by <hi>Iphigenes:</hi> There abſolute <hi>Remiſſions</hi> caſt all offences into <hi>Oblivion;</hi> There <hi>Iphigenes</hi> charging herſelf with one part of the fault for having concealed her <hi>Secret</hi> ſo long from her dear <hi>Liante,</hi> and <hi>Liante</hi> accuſing himſelf to excuſe <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> bred a ſweet <hi>contention</hi> which pacified all other <hi>quarrells.</hi> There were made all the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and plighted all the <hi>Faiths</hi> neceſſary to ſwear an inviolable <hi>Fidelity.</hi>

               <p>In concluſion, to hide the <hi>blazing</hi> of this mutuall <hi>Fire</hi> from other's view, it was decreed in their ſecret <hi>Councill</hi> (whereof <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> was the <hi>Preſident</hi>) that <hi>Liante</hi> feining not to deſire to force <hi>Amiclea's</hi> will, ſhould ſeem to have cured himſelf of her <hi>Contempt</hi> by <hi>Deſpight,</hi> and turn his <hi>affection</hi> towards <hi>Oloria,</hi> in compaſſion of her <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and for conſideration of her <hi>Conſtancy</hi> rather than her <hi>Beauty.</hi> As for <hi>Iphigenes</hi> (all Obſtacles and Scruples beeing now taken away) It was judged convenient <hi>that</hi> hee ſhould make open profeſſion of careſſing and ſerving <hi>Amiclea,</hi> not without ſome handſomely contrived inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the deferring his <hi>re-ſearch</hi> untill the treaty of <hi>Peace</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And to render their <hi>Deſign</hi> leſs perceptible, they added this induſtry, That <hi>Liante</hi> ſhould continue in his diſſatisfaction of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> and (although abſolutely free from <hi>Paſſion</hi> for <hi>Amiclea</hi>) ſhould how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtill make a ſhew of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> at leaſt of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Choller</hi> againſt him, as having robbed him of that <hi>Ladie's</hi> Heart, which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>As they reſolved, ſo was it executed: Inſomuch that <hi>Oloria</hi> became no leſs contented to ſee him (who had ſo much deſpiſed her) make his addreſſes to her, than <hi>Amiclea</hi> to ſee herſelf delivered of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, juſt as ſhee was upon the point of rendring herſelf to the imperious compulſion of her <hi>Parents.</hi> But when ſhee knew it was to give <hi>Iphigenes</hi> the place, whoſe mutuall <hi>Love</hi> was the height of her <hi>Deſires,</hi> you may imagine, in that condition, if ſhee could refrain from telling her <hi>Mother (Iphigenes</hi> having injoyned her to keep it ſecret, purpoſely that ſhee ſhould divulge it;) and her <hi>Mother,</hi> beeing a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> could not hold long from acquainting her <hi>Husband,</hi> which raiſed his thoughts to the <hi>Skies,</hi> beeing carried upon the <hi>Wings</hi> of the <hi>Hope</hi> hee conceived to have the <hi>Favorite</hi> of <hi>Polonia</hi> for his <hi>Son-in-Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This imagination contributed not a little to the advancement of the <hi>King's</hi> ſervice, and the publick <hi>Peace.</hi> For <hi>Olavius</hi> having great credit in the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Party, induced them to ſubmit to diverſe of the <hi>King's</hi> Demands, deſiring to conclude the <hi>Peace,</hi> that thoſe allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be brought to perfection.</p>
               <p>Whileſt our <hi>Lovers</hi> ſwam in the contentment of their reciprocall <hi>affections,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> which, like the <hi>Sea,</hi> hath nothing more <hi>conſtant</hi>

Which was effected according to his deſire, <hi>Liante</hi> beeing retired into the <hi>Caſtellain</hi> of <hi>Cracovia's</hi> Quarters, who in deſpight of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> ambuſhes cauſed him to bee ſafely convoyed into <hi>Minſce, Iphigenes</hi> ſtill accompanying him, with a reſolution to treat his own <hi>Father</hi> like an <hi>Enemy,</hi> if hee had come to aſſault them. This ſo inraged <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> that the next day hee reſolved to bee revenged of his <hi>Son;</hi> therein not much unlike an irritated <hi>Maſtif,</hi> who bite's the ſtone not beeing able to reach him that threw it. And in effect when hee thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, after the Aſſembly, according to his Cuſtome into the <hi>City, Mieſlas</hi> ſeized on him, ſaying, <hi>that as a perfidious</hi> Traitor <hi>to the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Publick, <hi>hee would ſacrifice him to Example, and like a brutall and unnaturall</hi> Brutus <hi>make him die by his own hands in the view of the whole</hi> Army. <hi>Iphigenes</hi> who knew that ſuch an execution could not bee
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:51476:177"/> done without the formes of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and beſides feeling himſelf inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſubmitted without reſiſtance, deſiring that they would execute upon his perſon all the cruelties they could imagine, if they found him guilty of any perſidious Action towards his <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Country.</hi> This was onely a pretence which <hi>Mieſlas</hi> had framed to effect what you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>The rumour of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> affections to <hi>Amiclea,</hi> and the report of their <hi>Marriage</hi> beeing noiſed through the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Minſce,</hi> by the communication of the Beſiegers with the Beſieged during the <hi>Truce,</hi> the <hi>Royall Camp</hi> was filled with this newes, and at laſt it came to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia's</hi> Ears. This incenſed him with the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt his <hi>Son,</hi> that hee had ever yet conceived; nothing beeing more ſenſible to <hi>Parents,</hi> than when their Children marry againſt their Wills, and match themſelves with perſons whom they think not fit for them. Hereupon hee took occaſion to detein his <hi>Son,</hi> and accuſe him of <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>Polonians,</hi> becauſe hee was about to contract an Alliance with the <hi>Lithuanians.</hi> Beſides, beeing a Man of Blood and Slaughter, hee produced diverſe Arguments againſt the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and hating mortally the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> hee could not indure that they ſhould participate, as <hi>Compatriots,</hi> of the <hi>honours</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Polonia,</hi> which was the principall point of all the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Inſomuch that deſiring to hinder this agreement, hee took this pretence of keeping his <hi>Son,</hi> knowing that thoſe of <hi>Minſce</hi> would preſently take Armes hereupon, and ſo the <hi>Truce</hi> ſhould bee broken.</p>
               <p>As hee preſuppoſed, it ſucceeded; For, immediately the <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſhut their Gates, incloſing and keeping Priſoners no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Royall</hi> Army, beſides thoſe that were delivered as hoſtages for the perſon of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> This bred much confuſion and tumults on both ſides: Whereunto <hi>Mieſlas</hi> added this <hi>ſtratagem.</hi>

               <p>There were certain Souldiers, who for ſome crimes were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Execution. One of theſe hee cauſed to bee clad with a Suite of the ſame colour of that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> then wore, and the next Morning, having commanded a Scaffold to bee raiſed in ſight of the whole <hi>Camp</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> hee gave out that with his own hand hee would cut off his <hi>Son's</hi> head, for beeing a <hi>Traitor</hi> to His <hi>Majeſty.</hi> The fatall hour beeing come, hee drew up all his own quarters in <hi>Battalia;</hi> then having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Criminall</hi> to bee ſet upon the Scaffold, and cloathed the <hi>Executioner</hi> with an habit not unlike his own, by this ſpectacle hee
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:51476:177"/> intended to take away from thoſe of the <hi>City</hi> all hopes of re-poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> by whom they expected much favour from the <hi>King</hi> in the concluſion of the <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> beeing kept cloſe <hi>Priſoner</hi> in a <hi>Chamber,</hi> knew nothing of all this; But what became <hi>Liante</hi> at this deplorable ſight? What <hi>Amiclea?</hi> what <hi>Olavius?</hi> what the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Troc?</hi> What all the <hi>Ladies?</hi> What all the Inhabitants of <hi>Minſce?</hi> It was then no time to ſit in conſultation; all of what quality ſoever demaunded a <hi>Sally,</hi> which could bee no more refuſed by the <hi>Palatines</hi> that commanded, than a paſſage hindered to the fury of an impetuous Torrent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> like the <hi>Poet's</hi> deſperate <hi>Coroebus,</hi> ſeeing his <hi>Caſſandra</hi> drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Block, placed himſelf at the head of this reſolute Party; and flying out of the <hi>City-gates</hi> with no leſs fury than a fell <hi>Lyoneſs</hi> haſt's from her Denn to reſcue her ſtolen <hi>Whelps,</hi> filling the whole <hi>Foreſt</hi> with her horrid roaring, precipitated himſelf to ſeek <hi>Death</hi> in the thickeſt of the <hi>Enemie's</hi> Squadrons, beeing reſolved to <hi>die</hi> a thouſand times or ſave <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Life.</p>
               <p>If all things elſe give place to <hi>Love,</hi> it was verified at that time; for, if the aſſault was violent on the <hi>Lithuanian's</hi> part, the reſiſtance was but weak on the <hi>Polonians,</hi> in regard divers Souldiers (not well pleaſed to ſee their companion executed) made way forthe Aſſailers, and gave them ſo cleer paſſage by their flight, partly <hi>Voluntary,</hi> partly <hi>Forc'd,</hi> that <hi>Liante</hi> arrived at the Scaffold as ſodain as a flaſh of <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> where terribly ſlaſhing th'<hi>Executioner</hi> (whom hee took to bee <hi>Mieſlas</hi>) hee thought at the ſame time to rid himſelf of a mortall <hi>Enemy</hi> and ſave the <hi>Life</hi> of a <hi>Perſon</hi> whom hee eſteemed the deareſt in the <hi>World.</hi> But having found out the deceipt, hee ceaſed not to end the <hi>Hangman,</hi> and ſet the <hi>Criminall</hi> at Liberty, having cut the Cords that bound him, and given him an opportunity to eſcape in the Throng.</p>
               <p>Never were greater feats of <hi>Arms</hi> ſeen done by <hi>Man,</hi> than thoſe which <hi>Deſpair, Love</hi> and <hi>Anger</hi> produced from <hi>Liante</hi> in this Action, thinking hee had fought in the preſence of the perſon beloved, whom hee deſired to give the ſtrongeſt proof of <hi>affection</hi> that is betwixt <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls</hi> (which is) <hi>to lay down his own Life to preſerve another's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who ſuſpected they would make a <hi>Sally,</hi> had prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a conſiderable <hi>Party</hi> of Horſe to intercept them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, and incloſe them between the <hi>Army</hi> and his <hi>Men.</hi> But having a bad <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and a cruell <hi>Reſolution</hi> to cut them all off, eſpecially
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:51476:178"/> 
                  <hi>Liante,</hi> if hee fell into his hands, his Enterpriſe turned to his own confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and he found himſelf intrapped in his own ſnares. For, they, having releaſed the <hi>Criminall,</hi> another ſtrong <hi>Party</hi> was ſent out of <hi>Minſce</hi> to ſuccour the former, and facilitate their retreat. Inſomuch that <hi>Mieſlas</hi> and his Men beeing ingaged betwixt both <hi>Parties,</hi> the Souldiers were almoſt all killed, his Horſe was ſhot under him, and hee beeing woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Thigh, beſides bruiſed with a fall, and loaden with Armes, was conſtrained, with an incredible <hi>Despair,</hi> to render himſelf <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,</hi> and remit his <hi>Life</hi> to the mercy of <hi>Liante,</hi> who threatned him with the cruelleſt of <hi>Deaths,</hi> if it appeared that hee had attempted any thing againſt <hi>Iphigenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to ſave his <hi>Life</hi> aſſured <hi>Liante,</hi> that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had no other harme than to bee lock't up in a <hi>Chamber,</hi> and that hee had deviſed that <hi>Plot</hi> to execute a <hi>Criminall</hi> in his place, thereby to ſpare his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and hinder the alliance hee intended to make with the <hi>Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Upon this aſſurance <hi>Liante</hi> having commanded him to bee ſlung upon an Horſe, led him with diverſe others in <hi>Triumph</hi> through the <hi>City.</hi> To expreſs the <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> of that brutall <hi>Podolian</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire tearms that never yet were heard.</p>
               <p>As there were divers <hi>Polonians</hi> taken, ſo there were ſome <hi>Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that remained as pledges in the <hi>King's</hi> Camp, aſwell of thoſe that had ingaged too far in the <hi>Enemie's</hi> Quarters, as thoſe that were ſhut out of the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Minſce;</hi> leſt among <hi>Friends</hi> they ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let in <hi>Enemies,</hi> as is often ſeen in like occurrences. Among the reſt was found a <hi>Gentleman</hi> extreamly <hi>young,</hi> and whoſe marvellous <hi>beauty</hi> attracted the <hi>Eyes</hi> of every one, exciting much more <hi>Envy</hi> than <hi>Pitty,</hi> and much more <hi>Pitty</hi> than <hi>Anger.</hi> Hee was led to the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> who wondered that hee had taken Armes at ſuch tender years. After ſome demands hee deſired they would give him leave to ſee <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who (hee believed) would know him, having ſeen him in <hi>Minſce.</hi> The <hi>Generall</hi> commanded his deſire ſhould bee ſatisfied: Do you ask if the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Plocens</hi> was aſtoniſhed to ſee that there was more than one <hi>Lady</hi> in the <hi>Army</hi> that bore <hi>Arms?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the pretty <hi>Amiclea,</hi> who upon the newes of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution had taken a ſodain reſolution to <hi>die,</hi> or revenge the <hi>Death</hi> of him whom ſhee loved with ſo much <hi>Paſſion.</hi> And ſeeing that all ſorts of <hi>People</hi> took Armes to follow <hi>Liante</hi> in that expedition; <hi>ſhall a Lover</hi> (ſaid ſhee to her ſelf) <hi>be ſaid to have leſs courage and fidelity than a Friend? No, no, I muſt, I will die gloriouſly; for, to ſurvive ſuch a
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:51476:178"/> loſs is a thing impoſſible for</hi> Amiclea. In this Reſolution ſhee went to her Brother <hi>Polemander's</hi> Armory, and having taken one of his Suits of apparell with an Armour, ſhee mounted one of her <hi>Father's</hi> beſt Horſes, the Servants thinking her to be <hi>Polemander;</hi> and in this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page ſhee ranked herſelf among thoſe that ſallied, and ingaged ſo far among the <hi>Enemies,</hi> that ſhee remained <hi>Priſoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a ſingular teſtimony of <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Generoſity;</hi> and <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> feining to requite this Obligation by conſummating of her hopes, was grieved at the <hi>Soul</hi> that hee could not recompence ſo great a <hi>Love</hi> as he could have deſired. If there was much joy within <hi>Minſce</hi> for the taking of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and a great deale of glory for the triumphing <hi>Liante,</hi> there was no leſs ſorrow for the loſs of <hi>Amiclea;</hi> no body could give an account what was become of her, neither ſhould they ever have imagined ſhee had done what ſhee did; Some were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that her <hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Iphigenes</hi> might perchance, through <hi>Despair,</hi> have made her make away herſelf in ſome ſecret Place, a violent remedy, yet frequently enough practiſed by weak <hi>Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shee was ſought for in every corner, but found no where; every one lamented her loſs, but the ſad Parents above all, in reſpect that beeing aſſured of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Life they loſt by this meanes the hope of an alliance, which they held infallible by the impriſonment of <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> and the promiſe of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> Who beeing ſet at liberty by expreſs command from the <hi>Caſtellain</hi> of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> Generall of the <hi>King's</hi> Army, took <hi>Amiclea</hi> with him to his Tent; where beeing preſently admitted, He ſaid, <hi>Seigneur Caſtellain, I beſeech you do not refuſe mee one grace that I ſhall demand at your hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seigneur Palatine,</hi> anſwered the Generall, <hi>ſince the</hi> King <hi>denies you nothing, I ſhould be very ill adviſed not to agree to any thing that you ſhall be pleaſed to deſire within the compaſs of that Power which His</hi> Majeſty <hi>hath committed to mee, especially being injoyned by particular Letters from him to give full credence to your Councells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Requeſt</hi> (replied Iphigenes) <hi>is onely that you will give mee this</hi> Priſoner, <hi>who is of ſuch quality, that I hope to get my</hi> Father <hi>exchanged for him. Sir,</hi> (anſwered the Generall) <hi>you may diſpoſe of him as you ſhall think fit, the</hi> Palatine, <hi>your</hi> Father, <hi>is the onely cauſe of his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: For, againſt all the Lawes of</hi> Arms, <hi>having violated the</hi> Truce, <hi>hee is but juſtly fallen into the Ditch which hee had digged for the Beſieged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord</hi> (ſaid Iphigenes) <hi>his particular diſaſter will be a benefit to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:51476:179"/> the</hi> Publick; <hi>For, whilest hee is in the</hi> Lithuanian's <hi>hands, wee ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to conclude the</hi> Treaty <hi>of</hi> Peace <hi>according to His</hi> Majeſtie's <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and renew the</hi> Truce. <hi>Mean time you ſhall ſee that this pretty</hi> Priſoner's <hi>Eyes are more redoubtable than his</hi> Sword, <hi>and that</hi> naked <hi>he is more powerfull than</hi> arm'd; with that lifting up <hi>Amiclea's</hi> Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, a long Treſs of golden hair fell about her ſhoulders: <hi>And judge you</hi> (continued hee) <hi>if I could periſh beeing defended by ſuch fair hands,</hi> It is not needfull to relate the aſtoniſhment of thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this agreeable Spectacle, where <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> appeared in a new equipage. If diverſe would have eſteemed themſelves happy to ſerve ſo exquiſite a <hi>Beauty,</hi> how happy ought they to account <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who was beloved and ſerved by her with ſuch proofs of <hi>Affection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Plocens</hi> word obliging him to render himſelf priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner again to the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> beſides his own inclinations, and the deſire hee had to free his <hi>Hoſtages</hi> from further trouble (of whom <hi>Piſides</hi> was one) hee returned with his pretty <hi>Champion;</hi> who not daring to appear before her Parents in that manner, deſired <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to make her <hi>Peace,</hi> before ſhee came in their ſight. His excuſes for <hi>Amiclea's</hi> diſguiſement were ſo well received, that <hi>Olavius</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> commended her for that adventure as an <hi>Heroick</hi> Act, and which would afterwards make her bee reckoned among the <hi>Amazons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> beeing ſhut up, like a mad wild <hi>Beaſt,</hi> in a Tower (where for his <hi>Son's</hi> ſake hee was treated according to his Quality) the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> went forwards. The <hi>Truce</hi> was re-eſtabliſhed more free than before: the <hi>King</hi> diſowned <hi>Mieſlas</hi> for having acted againſt the Law of <hi>Arms,</hi> and ſent a <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> power to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the <hi>Lithuanians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this <hi>Conference</hi> there was nothing but Sports, Turnaments, Dancings, Comedies, Banquets, and all ſorts of rejoycing of both <hi>Parties,</hi> infallible preſages of an happy <hi>Peace.</hi> Among other <hi>Playes</hi> repreſented at the Caſtle of <hi>Minſce,</hi> for the recreation of the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and thoſe of the <hi>Camp</hi> that came to viſit them, <hi>Liante</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Players</hi> to act the <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Iphigenia, Agamemnon's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as beeing a lively <hi>Image</hi> of that which had paſſed in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Criminall,</hi> who ſhould have been executed in the place of <hi>Iphigenes:</hi> Wherein there was not any of the Spectators ſo dull, but eaſily comprehended that the <hi>Hinde</hi> placed in <hi>Iphigeniae's</hi> ſtead, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:51476:179"/> the poor <hi>Souldier</hi> whom <hi>Mieſlas</hi> made paſs for <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> that the <hi>Anger</hi> of the <hi>Goddeſs</hi> offended for her <hi>Stag,</hi> expreſſed the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>King</hi> for the impriſoning of his <hi>Favorite;</hi> every one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted this <hi>Embleme</hi> according to his own fancy; But no body could conceive that the Marriage of <hi>Pylades</hi> with <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> had any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our <hi>Lovers,</hi> and that <hi>Oreſtes</hi> beeing cured of the <hi>Furies,</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the appeaſing of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> Fury: Yet Hee began to bee more tame, ſeeing himſelf a <hi>Priſoner.</hi> And as there is no man ſo covetous, who will not bee prodigall of his Eſtate to ſave his Life, the Propoſition of reſtoring to <hi>Liante</hi> what hee had ſo long detained from him, and giving him one of his <hi>Daughters</hi> in Marriage, ſeemed no more ſo ſtrange to him.</p>
               <p>There is no Creature ſo daunted as a <hi>Wolf,</hi> when hee is catcht in a ſnare; nothing ſo tractable as a cruell <hi>Man,</hi> when hee is in his <hi>Enemie's</hi> power. This fierce <hi>Palatine</hi> condeſcended to whatſoever they would, eſteeming it a favour if <hi>Liante</hi> (quitting the pretentions hee had to <hi>Clemencia,</hi> whom hee had promiſed to the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi>) would take any of his other Daughters, leaving him the benefit of his <hi>Eſtate</hi> during his Life. But <hi>Liante</hi> ſeemed to ſlight his Offers, not to give any occaſion of diſtaſt to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Minſce,</hi> who was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make him his <hi>Son-in-law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mean time the Article for the reſtitution of <hi>Liante's</hi> Eſtate paſſed among the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> which at length was concluded by the diligence and dexterity of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who had all the glory of that good Office. This <hi>Treaty</hi> beeing ratified by the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> was proclaimed with incomparable rejoycings on both ſides. That done, the <hi>Siege</hi> was forthwith raiſed, the <hi>Souldiers</hi> disbanded, <hi>Armes</hi> laid down, the <hi>Priſoners</hi> releaſed, and <hi>Mieſlas</hi> got off better cheap than hee expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was immediately repealed to the <hi>Court;</hi> where both their <hi>Majesties</hi> burned with impatience to ſee him crowned with <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches</hi> interwoven with <hi>Laurells</hi> and <hi>Palms.</hi> There hee promiſed <hi>Olavius</hi> to uſe his indeavours to procure the <hi>King's</hi> conſent to his marriage with <hi>Amiclea,</hi> and <hi>Liante's</hi> to <hi>Oloria;</hi> which the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Minſce</hi> held for a ſingular obligation, and the two Siſters were infinitely pleaſed. The joyes of <hi>Cracovia</hi> at the beautifull <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi> returne, may bee gueſſed by the regrets of the inhabitants of <hi>Minſce,</hi> who by his abſence thought they indured a perpetuall <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> and could almoſt have wiſh't that the <hi>Warr</hi> had ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:51476:180"/> to have injoyed the happineſs of poſſeſſing him longer.</p>
               <p>To relate the Pomp and Magniſicence of <hi>Iphigene's</hi> reception, were to undertake the deſcription of a great <hi>King's</hi> entrance into ſome <hi>Metropolitan</hi> City. For, as the <hi>King,</hi> to ſhew that the ſending him into his <hi>Palatinate,</hi> was a <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>State</hi> rather than a <hi>diſgrace,</hi> would have his <hi>Courtiers</hi> accompany him when hee left the <hi>Court;</hi> At his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hee commanded all thoſe that deſired to pleaſe him, ſhould go to meet him, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>World</hi> might ſee hee re-entred more in his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> than hee was before; and <hi>that</hi> if formerly hee had loved him by <hi>inclination,</hi> then hee cheriſhed him for <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and (if a <hi>Subject</hi> can oblige his <hi>Sovereign</hi>) by <hi>obligation.</hi> So, all thoſe of the <hi>Court</hi> went to receive him at a good diſtance from the <hi>City;</hi> even his <hi>Enemies,</hi> who ſaw themſelves his <hi>Foot-ſtoole,</hi> rendered him that <hi>Devoir;</hi> and although they had done him all the ill Offices they could deviſe, they prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered under <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> the <hi>Despight</hi> which gnawed their <hi>Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> beſides his re-purchaſed <hi>Liberty</hi> was raviſht to ſee ſo many <hi>Laurells</hi> ſhadowing his <hi>Son's Temples,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> ſhowring down upon his head; conceiving that <hi>hee</hi> had a ſhare in thoſe applauſes, in regard a vertuous <hi>Son</hi> is a <hi>Crown</hi> to his <hi>Father.</hi> His Siſter <hi>Clemencia,</hi> who for his ſake was much cheriſhed by the <hi>Queen,</hi> could not contein her joy to ſee her <hi>Brother</hi> appear like the <hi>Sun</hi> crown'd with <hi>Rayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As there was no intereſt that touched <hi>Iphigenes</hi> heart ſo neer as that of <hi>Liante,</hi> his re-eſtabliſhment was one of the firſt things hee moved to the <hi>King;</hi> and having made His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſee into his intentions, and conſider the <hi>Deſpair</hi> which had inforced him to caſt himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> with an advantageous repreſentation of what hee had contributed, for His <hi>Majestie's</hi> ſervice, to the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> (who was a very gracious <hi>Prince</hi>) received him into Grace, and promiſed <hi>Iphigenes</hi> not onely to revoak the confiſcation of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> but to re-eſtabliſh him therein, and contribute to the augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>Fortune</hi> according as occaſions ſhould bee preſented. This was a good beginning for <hi>Liante,</hi> who participated more than any other of the <hi>influences</hi> of his beautifull <hi>Star.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhall wee ſay nothing of the contentment of the <hi>Princeſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicia,</hi> who was now arrived at the top of her <hi>Deſires?</hi> For, ſhee had received from <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>dispenſation</hi> that was required to make the Marriage of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> with <hi>Modeſtina</hi> bee declared void; Inſomuch
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:51476:180"/> that relying upon her beloved <hi>Palatine's</hi> promiſe ſhee held the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of her's unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p>It is not my deſign to deſcribe here the manner of the <hi>King's</hi> and <hi>Queen's</hi> entertainments and reception of <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> the pleaſure of the <hi>Ladies,</hi> and the joy of the whole <hi>Court</hi> at the appearance of that welcome <hi>Sun</hi> upon the <hi>Horizon</hi> of <hi>Cracovia.</hi> I ſhall onely ſay that their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> beeing cured of the <hi>ſuſpitions</hi> which the <hi>Malice</hi> of his <hi>Enviers</hi> had caſt into their <hi>Souls,</hi> conſpired who ſhould give the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt teſtimonies of <hi>Benevolence</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> whom the voyce of the <hi>People</hi> (which is commonly that of <hi>God</hi>) ſtyled <hi>the</hi> PEACE MAKER <hi>of</hi> POLONIA, <hi>the</hi> RECONCILER <hi>of the</hi> POLONIANS <hi>and</hi> LITHUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANS, <hi>the</hi> ANGELL <hi>of</hi> PEACE, <hi>the</hi> GLORY <hi>of his Country, the</hi> HONOUR <hi>of his Family, and the</hi> JOY <hi>of all his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots.</hi>

               <p>They often conſulted together with what worthy recompence they ſhould requite the Services and Merits of ſuch a <hi>ſubject:</hi> At length not beeing able to offer him any part of that <hi>Kingdome</hi> (whereof they had onely the uſe, not the propriety) they believed that nothing could oblige his Noble <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſo much as ſome eminent <hi>Alliance,</hi> that might approach him to their <hi>Parentage</hi> and the <hi>Honour</hi> of their <hi>Blood.</hi> So, whether it was their own motion, or whether the <hi>Princeſs Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimunda,</hi> the <hi>King's</hi> Siſter, had ſpoken any thing to the <hi>Queen,</hi> having taken her part of the <hi>Court-vertigo</hi> by the infection of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> eyes, yet had through <hi>Modeſty</hi> concealed her <hi>affection;</hi> Which way ſoever it hapned, they determined to give him the <hi>Infanta</hi> in marriage with a dowry ſuitable to her quality.</p>
               <p>In the preſence of this great <hi>Star</hi> neither <hi>Modeſtina, Reſpicia, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> nor any of the reſt whoſe <hi>pretentions</hi> beeing hidden, their <hi>flames</hi> were the more violent, appeared with any luſter; there was nothing but <hi>Despair</hi> in their Hearts, <hi>Sobs</hi> in their breſts, <hi>Sighs</hi> in their Mouths, and <hi>Tears</hi> in their Eyes. But how, think you, was <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſurpriſed, when the <hi>King,</hi> in preſence of the <hi>Queen,</hi> told him in his cloſet the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he intended to do him, making him his <hi>Brother-in-Law</hi> by giving him his own <hi>Siſter</hi> to <hi>Wife?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which words hee fell upon his knees before their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> and repreſented to them all the arguments hee could deviſe to divert them from that Deſigne, which hee aſſured them would bee as ruinons to him as honourable; For, <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> lifting him aloft as the <hi>Eagle</hi> doth the <hi>Tortoize,</hi> threatned him with a fatall fall; <hi>That</hi> beeing raiſed
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:51476:181"/> from a <hi>Mole-hill</hi> to a <hi>Mountaine,</hi> that <hi>Eminency</hi> would expoſe him to the outragious <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> and <hi>Thunder-claps</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that</hi> thereby hee ſhould become the <hi>Blank</hi> and <hi>Butt</hi> of all the wounding <hi>Tongues</hi> of thoſe, who having ſeen him their equall would caſt deſpightfull glances upon the elevation of his <hi>Fortune. That</hi> hee knew not how the <hi>Lady Infanta</hi> herſelf ſtood inclined, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance would bee unwilling to abaſe herſelf ſo low as to marry a private <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who was nothing in the <hi>World</hi> but what it pleaſed His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to make him. <hi>That</hi> competent <hi>Fortunes,</hi> as the moſt certain, were the moſt deſirable. <hi>That</hi> hee beſeeched His <hi>Majesty</hi> to conſider, his <hi>Enemies</hi> would attribute to his <hi>Ambition,</hi> what proceeded from his Royall <hi>Benevolence. That</hi> hee was too conſcious of his own mean condition to entertain a thought of lifting his <hi>Eyes</hi> towards a <hi>Subject</hi> of ſo high a <hi>Dignity,</hi> whoſe too great luſtre would dazle him in ſtead of giving him light. <hi>Therefore</hi> hee conjured His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to preſerve in him the work of his own hands, and not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him unhappy by too much happineſs. <hi>That</hi> as Lamps (if over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with Oyl) go out, So <hi>Fortunes</hi> that are too vaſt commonly come to nothing. <hi>That</hi> queaſy ſtomacks ought not to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd with Meat, nor weak-braines with much Wine: <hi>That</hi> the Fabrick ought to bee proportionable to the Foundation, leſt it ſhould fall to the ground by it's own weight. <hi>That</hi> this were to ſet a <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> upon a <hi>Pedeſtall</hi> of <hi>Clay,</hi> and expoſe him to the fury of all the <hi>Grandee's</hi> jealouſies, in ſtead of ſheltering him from their rages.</q> And for his laſt Reaſon hee reſerved his <hi>Marriage</hi> with <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> after which (hee having concluded with the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſupplications, and the moſt indearing Conjurations hee could invent to turn away that <hi>tempeſt</hi> from him:) The <hi>King</hi> anſwered grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> all his <hi>Reaſons</hi> were full of <hi>Humility, Modeſty, Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> but yet they ought to ſubmit to his <hi>Command. That</hi> ſuch was his <hi>Will,</hi> which hee could not reſiſt without Crime. <hi>That</hi> it was the Propriety of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the greateſt point of their reſemblance to <hi>God,</hi> to raiſe the poor out of the Mud, and place them among the <hi>Princes</hi> and moſt conſiderable Perſons of their Kingdoms: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Little</hi> ones would never become <hi>Great,</hi> and the wheele of <hi>Fortune</hi> would remain without motion. <hi>That Vertues</hi> were more deſirable and eſtimable than Birth, and ſince <hi>they</hi> made the firſt <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> by <hi>them</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Monarchies</hi> were
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:51476:181"/> ſeated upon <hi>Thrones</hi> thoſe that had moſt merit, it was but reaſonable to prefer <hi>them</hi> before <hi>Scepters</hi> and <hi>Diadems. That</hi> his Siſter's minde was but too well known to him, who (beſides that ſhee was ready to ſubmit in all things to his <hi>Will</hi>) had a particular inclination to him, which made her deſire that Marriage. <hi>That</hi> in ſtead of beeing abaſed, ſhee would eſteem her ſelf exalted, and in ſtead of loſing her <hi>glory</hi> by that <hi>alliance,</hi> ſhee would communicate her <hi>ſplendour</hi> to him. <hi>That</hi> had it been in his <hi>Power</hi> to have given him a part of his Kingdome, hee would have done it as a teſtimony of his affection and gratitude: <hi>But,</hi> having no <hi>Crown</hi> more illuſtrious than that of his <hi>Blood,</hi> hee had determined to give him the <hi>Infanta Florimunda</hi> with means ſufficient to maintain ſo honourable a Conſanguinity. <hi>That</hi> this Match in ſtead of expoſing to, would exempt him from the <hi>Malice</hi> of his <hi>Enviers,</hi> by the ſame reaſon as the <hi>Stars</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from <hi>Eclipſes</hi> by their elevation and diſtance from the Earth. <hi>That</hi> during his <hi>Reign</hi> hee ought not to fear any retrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or Declining of <hi>Fortune,</hi> in regard Hee was a <hi>Prince</hi> that did not take pleaſure in deſtroying his own <hi>Creatures;</hi> beſides the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance his opinion gave him that <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> by the <hi>Prudence</hi> of his conduct, would give his <hi>Sovereign</hi> no ſuch occaſion. <hi>That</hi> Hee would ſo eſtabliſh him, that after his deceaſe, no power of <hi>Polonia</hi> ſhould bee able to diminiſh his <hi>Grandeurs.</hi> As for his <hi>Marriage</hi> with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destina,</hi> hee replied, <hi>that</hi> it was declared void by a <hi>Breviat</hi> ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Arch biſhop</hi> of <hi>Gneſna</hi> to be notified in publick; which having been procured by the <hi>Princeſs Reſpicia,</hi> ſhould ſerve for the <hi>Infanta Florimunda.</hi>
                  </q> The <hi>King</hi> ended his Speech with <hi>Such is our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> WILL <hi>and</hi> PROPER MOTION, which are tearms ſo <hi>ſovereign</hi> and <hi>ſacred,</hi> that the Oath of the fabulous <hi>Deities</hi> by the River <hi>Styx</hi> was not more inviolable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> added hereunto her perſwaſions mingled with intreaties, &amp; ſuch certain teſtimonies of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> affection to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> that it plainly appeared to proceed as much from the <hi>Princeſſe's</hi> own ſollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as their <hi>Majeſties</hi> deliberation. Inſomuch that the fair <hi>Palatine</hi> was inforced to yeild to ſo many ſweetly imperious violences, and receive with acknowledgements full of modeſt baſhfulneſs, what hee could not refuſe without highly offending their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the <hi>Infanta</hi> beyond hope of Pardon. Neither had hee been ſo indiſcreet, if <hi>Nature</hi> had not oppoſed to that eminent <hi>Fortune</hi> the obſtacles you already know: Which hee was even ready to declare to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:51476:182"/> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen;</hi> But conſidering that ſhee (how great ſoever in <hi>Dignity</hi>) was yet of that <hi>Sex,</hi> to which <hi>Prudence</hi> forbid's the revealing of any <hi>ſecret</hi> without deliberation, hee forbore, reſerving that <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> only, whoſe authority and adviſe hee intended to implore for the effecting of his intentions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> was no ſooner gone forth, but ſhee met the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who was as impatient to know the reſult of their Mediation, as the other was to tell her it; whereof <hi>Florimunda</hi> conceived ſuch joy as cannot bee comprehended but by a full-ripe <hi>Virgin,</hi> who receive's an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of marrying him whom ſhee love's with paſſion. After the <hi>Queen's</hi> departure, leſt the rumour of his marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſhould bee noiſed about the <hi>Court, Iphigenes</hi> judged it requiſite to ſqueeze the <hi>Scorpion</hi> upon the wound, and <hi>apply speedily</hi> the remedy to that growing miſchief.</p>
               <p>So, having beſeeched the <hi>King</hi> to give him a private <hi>Audience,</hi> wherein hee promiſed to diſcover the moſt marvellous <hi>Hiſtory</hi> hee ever yet had heard, Hee related him that of his <hi>Birth, Sex, Education, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Progreſs, Fortune,</hi> and unparalel'd <hi>affection</hi> to <hi>Liante;</hi> in ſumme, hee concealed nothing from his <hi>Maſter,</hi> of all the remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages expreſſed in this <hi>Narration;</hi> and at the cloſe of his recitall, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf at his feet, imbracing and kiſſing them, and waſhing them with his tears, hee humbly beſought His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to look on him as his poor and unworthy <hi>Creature,</hi> and diſpoſe of his <hi>Fortune</hi> according to his good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King's</hi> aſtoniſhment at this ſtrange <hi>Story</hi> can leſs bee deſcribed, than a flaſh of <hi>Lightning,</hi> or the <hi>Sun ſhine</hi> bee repreſented in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His admiration was ſuch, that hee remained a long while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beeing able to ſpeak but with his <hi>Eyes,</hi> which were fixt with much amiableneſs upon <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> This firſt aſſault wanted not much of converting his <hi>Amitre</hi> into <hi>Amorouſneſs</hi> and making his <hi>Favorite</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not his <hi>Maſter,</hi> but his <hi>Miſtris.</hi> Yet His <hi>Majeſtic's</hi> old Age which invited him to <hi>Temperance,</hi> his ſingular <hi>affection</hi> to the <hi>Queen,</hi> (who reigned over his <hi>Heart</hi> by her <hi>Vertues,</hi> as much as hee ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:51476:182"/> againſt which all unjuſt pretentions would ſuffer <hi>Shipwrack;</hi> Beſides, reading at that ſame inſtant in that lovely <hi>Face</hi> ſuch chaſte <hi>Characters,</hi> and ſo ſevere a ſweetneſs as ſtifled in their Birth all licentious imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>In this occurrence it would bee an injuſtice to conceale the due praiſes of that <hi>Prince,</hi> who made a <hi>Buckler</hi> of <hi>vertue</hi> againſt the <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> which <hi>Love,</hi> hidden within <hi>Iphigenes</hi> Eyes, treacherouſly darted againſt his <hi>Heart.</hi> But to deny <hi>that</hi> the affection, which rendered <hi>Iphigenes</hi> his <hi>Favorite,</hi> was much increaſed, by the diſcovery of his condition, cannot bee, without taking from ſo vertuous a <hi>Prince</hi> the quality (which is common to all great Perſons) of beeing extreamly courteous to <hi>Ladies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not extend my ſelf in relating the Proteſtations the <hi>King</hi> made to preſerve him in his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> notwithſtanding this <hi>Change;</hi> nor the praiſes of his <hi>Beauty</hi> which were as extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as the <hi>ſubject</hi> was beyond <hi>Nature's</hi> ordinary compoſitions. At laſt after diverſe <hi>Careſſes</hi> and Compliments, accompanied with thanks and reſentments of obligation to the deſerving <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> conjured him to declare freely and fully his deſires, promiſing by the Faith of a <hi>Prince</hi> to indeavour the effecting of them to the utmoſt of his <hi>Royall</hi> power.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Iphigenes</hi> illuminating his <hi>Beauty</hi> with a lively and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vermillion, which or'e-ſpread his cheeks; confeſſed to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> That after the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Benevolence,</hi> the height of his deſires was the legitimate poſſeſſion of his beloved <hi>Liante.</hi> How chaſte &amp; warrantable ſoever are the <hi>flames</hi> of honourable <hi>Virgins,</hi> it is impoſſible for them to acknowledge their <hi>Loves</hi> without painting their Faces with thoſe <hi>Colours</hi> which render the <hi>Aurora</hi> ſo agreeable; as if it were as great an imperfection in them to <hi>love,</hi> as it is a perfection to bee <hi>lovely.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> perceived by that livery of <hi>vertue</hi> the <hi>chaſtity</hi> of that generous <hi>spirit,</hi> which increaſed his eſteem of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> And beeing informed how that <hi>Paſſion</hi> had taken its birth in a manner from their Cradles, <hi>that</hi> a mutuall inclination had given it <hi>Beeing,</hi> Nouriſh't, Entertained, and Elevated it to its perfect <hi>ſtate,</hi> hee thought it a renouncing of all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> to diſapprove ſo legitimate an <hi>Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, having demanded of <hi>Iphigenes</hi> in what manner hee ſhould manage the diſcovery of that <hi>ſecret,</hi> which would aſtoniſh not onely all <hi>Polonia,</hi> but the whole <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe;</hi> our <hi>Amazon,</hi> who had princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally premeditated that part, gave His <hi>Majeſty</hi> the Overtures; which
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:51476:183"/> hee approved in all their circumſtances, according as ſhall bee declared in the <hi>Sequele</hi> of this <hi>Declaration.</hi> Onely to hinder the deſigne the <hi>King</hi> had for his <hi>Siſter</hi> from beeing divulged, it was thought expedient to apply a ſpeedy remedy, and raze the <hi>Paſſion</hi> out of that <hi>Princeſſe's</hi> heart, by making her believe that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was incapable of performing the Rites of <hi>Marriage:</hi> (an Opinion able to befroſt the moſt ardent flames.)</p>
               <p>This invention the <hi>King</hi> found very pertinent, and to execute it ſubtilely hee went to the <hi>Queen,</hi> who had already made the ordinary congratulations of joyfull newes to the <hi>Infanta</hi> (but with the <hi>ſeale</hi> wherewith <hi>Ladies</hi> are accuſtomed to cloſe their <hi>ſecrets,</hi> that is, a <hi>prayer to ſay nothing,</hi> as if a third Perſon were obliged to conceale that which they cannot keep in their own breſts:) And <hi>Florimunda</hi> had ſo well and diſcreetly kept this agreeable tidings, that ſhee had already communicated it to all her <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> but with the ſame caution as the <hi>Queen</hi> had told it her; and they all promiſed her to bee ſilent, but with this reſervation, <hi>when they had no body to ſpeak unto.</hi> Preſently among themſelves there was no other diſcourſe than of their <hi>Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe's</hi> ſodain marriage, and the more their <hi>Tongues</hi> itched to be tattling, the ſtricter their <hi>Command</hi> was not to mention it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> not knowing that the <hi>Queen</hi> had been ſo forward, told her <q>that <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had acquainted him with other matters than what was ſpoken in her preſence; and he was now fully ſatisfied, that thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excuſes and Conjurations, which hee had made to them not to preſs him to marry the <hi>Infanta,</hi> proceeded not from any want of Deſire, (hee not beeing ſo blinde as not to ſee the advantages hee ſhould receive by ſo glorious an <hi>alliance</hi>) but from a <hi>naturall</hi> diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to anſwer the expectations of a <hi>Bride.</hi>
                  </q> For proof whereof hee alleadged to her the <hi>non-conſummation</hi> of his <hi>Marriage</hi> with <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> beſides that extraordinary <hi>Continence</hi> which hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhewed at the <hi>Court,</hi> oppoſing ſuch cold reſervedneſs to the flames of ſo many <hi>Ladies,</hi> that burned ſo inexpreſſibly for his <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> amazed at this newes, was ſorry ſhee had ſo ſoon given her <hi>Siſter-in-law</hi> joy of a Contentment, that was vaniſhed e're poſſeſſ't, like <hi>Lightning</hi> which die's aſſoon as it is born. After ſome ingenious (but not offenſive) reproaches to the <hi>King</hi> for his former <hi>jealouſies</hi> of her, and having condoled that defect of <hi>Nature</hi> in ſo beautifull a perſon, Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> continued; <hi>But that which troubles

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51476:184"/> beget a belief in thoſe to whom ſhee had communicated it, <hi>that</hi> it had been more to comply with the <hi>King,</hi> than for any inclination of her own, that ſhee had entertained the thought of Marrying <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> And that His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> (like a kinde <hi>Brother,</hi> beeing unwilling to preſs her to a thing which ſhee had given him to underſtand was as little agreeable as advantageous to her,) had deſiſted importuning or therein, expecting ſome more eminent <hi>Alliance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this could not bee carried ſo ſecretly, but that the Winde whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered it in the Ears of the <hi>Princeſs Respicia,</hi> who (upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>King's</hi> Deſign of Marrying his Siſter with <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the rumour of his <hi>impotency</hi>) took the allarm ſo hot, that her <hi>Minde,</hi> tormented with ſeverall reſentments, indured no leſs agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than a <hi>Ship</hi> toſſed in the contention betwixt the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Tyde.</hi> At length ſhee did like thoſe that the <hi>Tempeſt</hi> drive's againſt the <hi>Rocks,</hi> who ſave their <hi>Lives</hi> in ſeeing their <hi>Veſſell</hi> ſplit. Shee fancied to herſelf that the <hi>Palatine,</hi> beeing more <hi>jealous</hi> of maintaning the <hi>promiſe</hi> hee had made her, than <hi>ambitious</hi> of the <hi>Honour</hi> that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him by Marrying <hi>Florimunda,</hi> had invented that <hi>Plot</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe himſelf hand ſomely of that <hi>alliance,</hi> which would have expoſed him to the <hi>Envy</hi> of all the <hi>Grandees.</hi> And, as <hi>Deſire</hi> is a grand <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> ſhee eaſily believed what ſhee deſired. <hi>Reaſons</hi> were not wanting to confirme this <hi>Belief. For, ſhee had never obſerved any thing in</hi> Iphigenes, <hi>but what was</hi> Generous. <hi>The proofs of his valour were not unknown to any but ſtrangers; All</hi> Polonia <hi>had ſeen him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Exploits of</hi> Warr, <hi>which</hi> Fame <hi>had not</hi> Tongues <hi>enough to celebrate. If hee was ſo able for</hi> Mars, <hi>could hee bee inept for</hi> Her whom Vulcan <hi>ſurpriſed with that</hi> God? <hi>This is a</hi> Charity <hi>which his</hi> Enemies <hi>do him (ſaid</hi> Shee <hi>not without Sighes) becauſe hee hath the</hi> Face <hi>of an</hi> Angell, <hi>they ſay hee is no</hi> Man; <hi>and his</hi> Enviers <hi>call him</hi> Effeminate; <hi>ſuppoſe hee bee ſo, is he the leſs fir for</hi> Women? <hi>That hee hath not accoſted</hi> Modeſtina, <hi>was becauſe</hi> Mieſlas <hi>alwayes hindered him. It is upon the delicacy of his</hi> Complexion <hi>that they have built this Lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did the abuſed <hi>Princeſs</hi> flatter herſelf in her own misfortune, beeing reſolved to ſee the effect of the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> which ſhee had procured from <hi>Rome</hi> with ſo much trouble. Having conjured <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> herſelf, and ſollicited him by <hi>Mieſlas</hi> to make good his <hi>word</hi> to her; his anſwer ſtill was, <hi>that his firſt Marriage beeing declared void, hee would marry her if ſhee were ſo contented:</hi> Hereupon Shee impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned dayly the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> to produce her <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> which was in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51476:184"/> his hands. But nothing in this caſe could bee done in the abſence of <hi>Modeſtina,</hi> whom (notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions <hi>Mieſlas</hi> could make) the <hi>King</hi> (incited thereto by <hi>Iphigenes</hi>) commanded to be ſent for to the <hi>Court.</hi> With her came <hi>Aretuza,</hi> Mother to <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> who though faithfully advertiſed of all theſe paſſages by <hi>Iphigenes</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlaüs,</hi> was ready to die with <hi>Fear,</hi> diſtruſting the ſucceſs of that ſtrange Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>To repeat the reproaches <hi>Modeſtina</hi> made to her fair <hi>Husband,</hi> the injurious tearms ſhee gave <hi>Respicia,</hi> and the reolution ſhee took to oppoſe herſelf till <hi>Death</hi> againſt the diſſolution of her <hi>Marriage,</hi> I eſteem needleſs. Hee that can imagine the reſentments of a <hi>Wife</hi> affronted in that manner, may gueſs how far her <hi>Choller</hi> tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Her.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Olavius</hi> having intelligence of the <hi>Princeſs Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia's</hi> pretenſions, of the arrivall of the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> and of <hi>Modeſtina's</hi> and <hi>Aretuza's</hi> coming to <hi>Court,</hi> conceived (for the intereſt of his <hi>Daughter</hi>) that hee was obliged to carry her thither. So, with his <hi>Wife, Polemander,</hi> his two Daughters <hi>Oloria</hi> and <hi>Amiclea,</hi> hee took his way to <hi>Cracovia,</hi> to ſee if hee could accompliſh the two <hi>alliances</hi> which hee had projected with <hi>Liante</hi> and <hi>Iphigenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> reſolved to keep himſelf reſerved in the reſearch of <hi>Clemencia,</hi> untill hee ſaw the ſucceſs of his <hi>Mother's</hi> pretenſions. <hi>Simphoroſa,</hi> his Siſter, grew every day in <hi>Bigneſs</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> but ſhee was yet ſo tender, that although ſhee was capable of breeding deſires in others, ſhee was not of entertaining any in herſelf; And by reaſon of her <hi>youth</hi> and attractive <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> ſhe was called in the <hi>Court</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> INNOCENT.</p>
               <p>There was no body but the <hi>King, Iphigenes, Aretuza, Liante</hi> and <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> that knew the <hi>Stratagem,</hi> which was then to bee put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the face of all the <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liante</hi> beeing importuned by <hi>Oloria,</hi> gave her not much ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but remitting himſelf to the <hi>King's</hi> will, and deferring her untill hee were re-eſtabliſhed in the Eſtate, which the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Podolia</hi> detained from him, hee amuſed her expectation. The <hi>King</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all things for his deſign, made <hi>Mieſlas</hi> condeſcend to give <hi>Liante</hi> of all his <hi>Daughters</hi> (except <hi>Clemencia</hi>) her whom hee ſhould fancy moſt, promiſing to give her a portion himſelf, and leave him the uſe of <hi>Liante's</hi> Eſtate during Life. It was not hard to perſwade the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian</hi> to imbrace this offer, whereby (beſides the great advantages
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51476:185"/> that accrued to him) hee ſaw all ſorts of Enmity, Hatred, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ceaſe. As for thoſe that were immur'd in the <hi>Cloiſter,</hi> their Veils (beſides their naturall deformities) were as a <hi>Buckler</hi> againſt all Worldly pretenſions. So that there was no remedy but to produce <hi>Virgenia</hi> (who for her reſemblance of Face and Faſhion to <hi>Iphigenes</hi> was commonly called <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> yet the World knew her not till then to bee <hi>Mieſlas</hi> Daughter.)</p>
               <p>Againſt all the oppoſitions <hi>Oloria</hi> could make to hinder this <hi>alliance,</hi> the <hi>King's</hi> authority ſerved for a defence and excuſe for <hi>Liante;</hi> and although the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Minſce</hi> murmured againſt this proceeding, hee was inforced to give over his ſuite, the ſupreme <hi>Law</hi> beeing the <hi>Prince's</hi> Will.</p>
               <p>That beeing thus determined, the next queſtion was to which of theſe three Graces <hi>Iphigenes</hi> ſhould appertain; to <hi>Modeſtina, Respicia,</hi> or <hi>Amiclea.</hi> The beautifull <hi>Palatine,</hi> who knew hee could bee injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by none of them, gave himſelf to them all with ſo cheerfull and free a behaviour, that each of them, thinking ſhee had the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in his <hi>affection,</hi> raiſed the <hi>Trophy</hi> of her <hi>Hopes</hi> to the <hi>Glory</hi> of poſſeſſing him. Each one preſumed on her prerogatives, and put her pretentions in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>MODESTINA <hi>alleadged that in all Juſtice</hi> IPHIGENES <hi>belong'd to her; For, ſhee was married to him, hee was her Husband.</hi> RESPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIA <hi>founded her plea upon her high Birth and Riches.</hi> AMICLEA <hi>drew her preheminence from her</hi> Beauty. All three made their Buckler of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Palatine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, hee had ſaid to his dear <hi>Modeſtina</hi> (whoſe diſaſter hee did really lament) <hi>that hee would never leave her as long as ſhee would have him for her Husband:</hi> Whereupon ſhee beeing reſolved never to ſay otherwiſe, held her victory infallible. <hi>Respicia,</hi> (ſupported by the <hi>Paternall</hi> authority of <hi>Mieſlas</hi> and the acknowledgement <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had made that hee never gave his conſent to the Marriage of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi>) eſteemed her Conqueſt no leſs certain. And <hi>Amiclea</hi> recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Memory the many <hi>Careſſes,</hi> inamored expreſſions, and ſeverall demonſtrations of <hi>affection,</hi> wherewith <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had fed her Fancy in <hi>Minſce,</hi> (beſides the immortall obligations ſhee had acquired upon that generous <hi>Spirit,</hi> by her ſallying out of the <hi>City</hi> in her Brother's Cloaths and Armour to ſuccour him; And then conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often with her Looking glaſs to remarke the great advantages <hi>Nature</hi> had given her over her two <hi>Rivalls</hi>) could not perſwade
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:51476:185"/> herſelf if the fair <hi>Palatine</hi> had any <hi>Love,</hi> that it could bee for any but her.</p>
               <p>Imagine you if the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> laughed not at theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; and if they had not occaſion to ſay <hi>that there was a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for a barren ground.</hi> All ſtood in expectation of the <hi>voyce</hi> of the <hi>Oracle,</hi> which was the <hi>ſentence</hi> of the <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> who beeing inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>King</hi> of the reality of the Story, and rendered participant of the Stratagem, after ſome uſuall formalities, pronounced the <hi>Marriage</hi> betwixt <hi>Modestina</hi> and <hi>Iphigenes</hi> void, by default of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment given in an age incapable of determining <hi>Wills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would bee hard to repreſent the reſentments of the poor <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> when ſhee heard this <hi>Sentence,</hi> which ſeemed no leſs cruell to her than if it had condemned her to <hi>Death;</hi> Nevertheleſs ſhee held yet by one thred of <hi>Hope,</hi> the word of <hi>Iphigenes.</hi> In this <hi>World</hi> the one's <hi>loſs</hi> is another's <hi>gain.</hi> This Decree opened the <hi>Heavens</hi> to <hi>Respicia,</hi> and made her ſing the <hi>Triumph</hi> before a perfect <hi>Victory.</hi> For this <hi>Marriage</hi> beeing diſſolved, ſhee believed there would bee no further obſtacle to her pretenſions; when <hi>Amiclea</hi> oppoſing herſelf to Her Deſignes, ſummoned <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to performe his <hi>promiſe</hi> to Her.</p>
               <p>It were impoſſible to relate the Diſcourſes that <hi>Jealouſie</hi> (which is an inraged <hi>Fury</hi>) put into the mouths of theſe <hi>Rivalls,</hi> Which had made diverſe Quarrells and Combats, but that the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> knew how to calm thoſe ſtorms. <hi>Modeſtina</hi> indeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite her <hi>Brother</hi> to fight with <hi>Iphigenes:</hi> (Conſider you to whom ſhee addreſſt herſelf, and what pleaſure the <hi>King</hi> took to hear her perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which <hi>Liante</hi> repeated to him.) <hi>Reſpicia</hi> preſſed her Son, the <hi>Prince Caſſin,</hi> to challenge <hi>Olavius</hi> or <hi>Polemander,</hi> to revenge her of <hi>Amiclea. Oloria</hi> conjured <hi>Polemander</hi> to ingage in ſingle Combat with <hi>Liante.</hi> And <hi>Amiclea</hi> was ſo tranſported with rage, that ſhee was almoſt reſolved to re-arm herſelf to take <hi>Prince Caſſin's</hi> Life in revenge of <hi>Reſpicia's</hi> oppoſing her <hi>deſires.</hi> At laſt beeing not able to ingage any others in their quarrells, <hi>Paſſion</hi> ſo bemadded them, that (had they not been hindered) they would have ended their differences with Poniard and Piſtoll (wherewith they had each armed themſelves) unfit inſtruments for the uſe of ſuch delicate Hands.</p>
               <p>In what contentment did His <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> fancy ſwim, ſeeing the Cards thus ſhuffled to his own deſire? At length beeing willing to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:51476:186"/> terminate all theſe differences (whereof hee reſerved the knowledge to himſelf) in as gracious as marvellous a manner, hee promiſed to content them all by his <hi>Judgement</hi> without commanding (like the <hi>Hebrew King</hi>) that <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſhould bee divided. Hereupon Hee prefix't a certain day to pronounce the deciſion of this controverſie, which (according to the opinion of the <hi>Pretendants</hi>) for one Happy was to make two Miſerable.</p>
               <p>The whole Deſign beeing conducted with an admirable ſecrecy, the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Infanta Florimunda</hi> accompanied with onely foure, or five of the principall <hi>Ladies</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> ſeated themſelves in the <hi>King's</hi> Chamber by his command. Then were called in the moſt part of thoſe, whom wee have named in this Hiſtory, and thoſe who had moſt frequently been in <hi>Iphigenes</hi> company, (for hee ſuggeſted to the <hi>King</hi> the contrivance of all this Deſign) Eſpecially the three <hi>Rivalls, Modeſtina, Respicia</hi> and <hi>Amiclea;</hi> the <hi>Palatine's</hi> three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall friends, <hi>Pomeran, Pifides</hi> and <hi>Argal;</hi> The <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Minſce</hi> and <hi>Troc</hi> with their Wives; <hi>Oloria</hi> followed her Mother, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindra</hi> her's; <hi>Polemander</hi> accompanied his Siſters; <hi>Perpetua</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced as <hi>Governeſs</hi> to <hi>Modestina; Aretuza</hi> entred with <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> as thoſe who next to their <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Ward</hi> had the principall intereſt in this buſineſs. Of <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> beeing there, you need not doubt; the <hi>Prince Caſſin</hi> accompanied his <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Clemencia</hi> attended on the <hi>Queen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> beeing inſtructed what hee was to do, was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as hee that ſhould give a bleſſing to the Feaſt, with other <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> of note, who knew nothing of the Deſigne. Mean time the King had commanded that <hi>Virgenia,</hi> (naturall Daughter to <hi>Mieſlas</hi>) ſhould bee conducted into his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> dreſſt like a <hi>Bride,</hi> and as if ſhee had been then to bee contracted to <hi>Liante,</hi> who with <hi>Iphigenes,</hi> ſumptuouſly apparelled, was brought into the ſame <hi>cloſet;</hi> where, in Coffers (whereof <hi>Iphigenes</hi> had the Keys) were Garments neceſſary for the repreſentation of the <hi>Comicall</hi> Action wee are now relating.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> having left them in his <hi>cloſet,</hi> returned into his <hi>Chamber,</hi> where during that grand <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> having briefly, but with much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity repreſented, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>having created</hi> Man <hi>free, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he abhorred more than to ſee</hi> Wills <hi>constrained;</hi> That <hi>beeing by the</hi> Providence <hi>of</hi> Heaven <hi>elevated to the</hi> Throne, <hi>to repreſent on</hi> Earth <hi>the</hi> Image <hi>of</hi> God <hi>in</hi> Heaven, <hi>he would never indure that the perſon whom
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:51476:186"/> hee honoured with his</hi> Favour <hi>ſhould bee forced in his</hi> inclinations, <hi>eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that which of all things in the</hi> World <hi>ought to bee moſt free, that is,</hi> Marriage. <hi>That hee had under-hand intimated to the three</hi> Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants <hi>a ſecret</hi> Cauſe <hi>which ought without further diſpute make them quit their</hi> pretentions; <hi>But that their</hi> Paſſion <hi>beeing ſtronger than their</hi> Reaſon, <hi>they flattered themſelves with a</hi> Belief, <hi>that his</hi> Information <hi>was, onely an artificiall</hi> Pretence <hi>to make them deſiſt from an</hi> Enterpriſe, <hi>wherein they could reap nothing but</hi> Shame. <hi>That by the mouth of the Church,</hi> Iphigenes <hi>having been declared free from his firſt</hi> Bonds, <hi>his</hi> Will <hi>was that hee ſhould not bee fettered a ſecond time contrary to his own</hi> deſire. <hi>That it was ſufficient, that againſt the</hi> Motions <hi>of his own</hi> Minde <hi>hee had already once teſtified his</hi> Obedience <hi>to his</hi> Parents <hi>by tying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to</hi> Modeſtina, <hi>without ſubmitting again his</hi> Will <hi>to their's for an</hi> Alliance <hi>disproportionable;</hi> That <hi>the</hi> Age <hi>of the</hi> Princeſs Reſpicia <hi>did oblige him rather to reverence her as a</hi> Mother, <hi>than cheriſh and reſearch her as a</hi> Wife; <hi>That her Daughter</hi> Simphoroza <hi>was yet too</hi> young <hi>for an</hi> Husband; <hi>That</hi> Amiclea <hi>might bee diſpenſed from</hi> Marriage <hi>for the ſame</hi> Reaſon, <hi>beſides that the</hi> promiſe <hi>of a</hi> Priſoner <hi>is never held to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any other</hi> motion <hi>than</hi> Compulſion. <hi>And in ſum, as well againſt</hi> that, <hi>as the</hi> paternall <hi>authority of</hi> Mieſlas, <hi>hee oppoſed his</hi> Royall <hi>and</hi> Soveraign <hi>Power, to remit purely and freely</hi> Iphigenes <hi>in the Liberty of his own</hi> Choyce. <hi>That hee had ſounded his</hi> Intentions, <hi>and beeing fully informed thereof by his ingenious</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>hee had beſides alleadged very pertinent</hi> Reaſons, <hi>that hindered him from</hi> Marrying <hi>any of thoſe three that deſired him. Which made him ingage his thoughts elſewhere, and</hi> contract <hi>a</hi> Marriage <hi>in private (which was then to bee made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and confirmed by the</hi> Church) <hi>with a ſimple</hi> Shepherdeſs <hi>named</hi> Almeria, <hi>whom hee found according to his own</hi> Heart, <hi>and who poſſeſſed as much</hi> ingenuity, Vertues <hi>and</hi> Graces <hi>as ſhee had little</hi> Beauty. <hi>That hee had made him ſee ſo cleer into the</hi> Purity, Innocency <hi>and</hi> Sincerity <hi>of that</hi> Affection, <hi>that in ſtead of blaming him for having abaſed his</hi> Spirit <hi>to a</hi> Subject <hi>ſo inferiour to his</hi> Birth <hi>and</hi> Condition, <hi>hee eſteemed him the more, judging how</hi> faithfull <hi>would hee bee to his</hi> King <hi>who had ſo</hi> religiouſly <hi>preſerved his</hi> Faith <hi>to ſo mean a</hi> Creature. <hi>That for theſe conſiderations impoſing</hi> Silence <hi>to his</hi> Father <hi>and</hi> Mother, <hi>and rejecting the</hi> Pretenſions <hi>of the three</hi> Rivalls, <hi>his</hi> Will <hi>and</hi> Pleaſure <hi>was, by</hi> vertue <hi>of his full and abſolute</hi> Power, <hi>and of his</hi> Royall Authority, that <hi>that</hi> Marriage <hi>ſhould bee celebrated by the</hi> Arch-biſhop, <hi>who had diſannull'd the former, and that immediately in the preſence of all that</hi> Company,

                  <hi>the</hi> Ruſtick Almeria <hi>having been brought ſecretly into the</hi> Palace <hi>for that purpoſe by his</hi> Command.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt words pronounced with a ſerious and <hi>Majeſtick</hi> accent, ſtopt the mouth (not without an extream impatience) of the irritated <hi>Mieſlas,</hi> who intended to do no leſs then kill <hi>Almeria</hi> with his own hands, or make her bee poyſoned within few dayes after her <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> What diſcourſes in the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> what <hi>Thoughts</hi> ran through the <hi>Minds</hi> of the three <hi>Rivalls,</hi> what <hi>pain</hi> had they to hold their pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſo fair and ſo preſſing an occaſion to ſpeak! One onely thing gave them the reſpit that <hi>Heart-breaking Grief</hi> denied them, which was, <hi>that</hi> this ceremony was onely to contract <hi>Iphigenes</hi> to <hi>Almeria,</hi> the <hi>Marriage</hi> beeing remitted to a more pompous ſolemnity; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they promiſed themſelves, during that intervall, to uſe new indeavours to breake that <hi>alliance,</hi> and procure the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own pretenſions; For, if betwixt the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and the <hi>Glaſs</hi> arrive diverſe accidents, ſeverall means might bee found in that interim to divert that blow which was ſo fatall to their <hi>Hopes:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, not daring to oppoſe the <hi>King's</hi> Will in his own preſence, every one remained in ſilence, when the <hi>King</hi> turning himſelf towards the <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> asked him <hi>if he was not ready to recive the</hi> Promiſes <hi>of the future Marriage of the</hi> Palatine <hi>of</hi> Plocens <hi>with the</hi> Shepherdeſs <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>MODESTINA, who was the moſt intereſſed, as having her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> torn out of her imbraces, replyed, <hi>That to give her the liberty of</hi> Speech <hi>after ſo ſolemn a</hi> Contracting, <hi>was to bring a</hi> Phyſitian <hi>after</hi> Death; <hi>beſides that the abſolute</hi> Will <hi>of His</hi> Majeſty <hi>was an inviolable</hi> Law <hi>to her, which muſt bee obeyed without murmuring; Yet if ſhee might bee leſt to her own free diſpoſition, ſhee would content herſelf to ſpin out the reſt of her dayes with</hi> Iphigtnes <hi>without experimenting him for an</hi> Husband <hi>any otherwiſe than ſhee had thitherto; accuſing him of little</hi> Friendſhip <hi>in that hee had not diſcovered that</hi> defect <hi>to her, which ſhee ſhould have hidden as well as that</hi> Country-wench: <hi>So</hi> Jealouſie <hi>made her tearme</hi> Almeria.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſs</hi> RESPICIA, who perſwaded herſelf it was a falſe report, proteſted <hi>that it was the</hi> Vertues <hi>of</hi> Iphigenes <hi>which made her deſire him, not his</hi> Beauties, <hi>nor the conſideration of</hi> pleaſure; (judge you how her Tongue correſponded with her Heart) <hi>and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his</hi> Infirmitie, <hi>ſhee would have Married him, having already</hi> Children <hi>enough to preſerve her</hi> Name <hi>and</hi> Memory.</p>
               <p>AMICLEA, who had abated ſomewhat of her <hi>ardour,</hi> would not however ſeem leſs affectionate than the reſt, and following their track, her <hi>Ditty</hi> was to the ſame <hi>Tune.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> hereupon told them <hi>that Marriages contracted with ſuch perſons were invalide.

               <p>The <hi>King</hi> ſmiling at this freedome of her's, replied; <hi>Princeſs, when the</hi> Scales <hi>are fallen from your</hi> Eyes, <hi>adn the</hi> Veile <hi>of</hi> Paſſion <hi>taken from before your</hi> Reaſon, <hi>I aſſure my ſelf that you will rather pitty than envy</hi> Iphigenes. <hi>Your favours,</hi> anſwered the Princeſs, <hi>will render him alwayes more worthy of Envy than Pitty.</hi> Upon theſe words <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> returning into the <hi>King's</hi> Chamber gave him notice by a private ſigne, that all was ready.</p>
               <p>Whereupon hee preſently commanded him to call <hi>Liante</hi> and IPHIGENIA to bee contracted by the <hi>Arch biſhop:</hi> The Ceremony beeing paſt without any contradiction, the two <hi>Lovers</hi> ſtanding hand in hand, <hi>Liante</hi> accompanied his coſtly <hi>apparrell</hi> with ſo gallant a <hi>Garb,</hi> that hee ſeemed quite another <hi>Creature</hi> than <hi>Almeria;</hi> and thoſe pretious Rayments wherewith <hi>Iphigenia</hi> had ſplendidly adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf, added ſuch <hi>Iuſter</hi> to her naturall <hi>Beauty</hi> (augmented by the vermillion of <hi>ſhame</hi> which overſpread her Cheeks) and her attire had ſuch conformity with that which <hi>Virgenia</hi> wore, when ſhee was brought into the <hi>Palace,</hi> together with the favour of the <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Shadineſs</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> that no body could know her on the ſodain for <hi>Iphigenes;</hi> there was not one but had his <hi>Eyes</hi> dazled at the ſplendour of ſo rare a <hi>Beauty,</hi> and not one <hi>Soul</hi> in the whole Company ſo Envious, as not to confeſs, ſeeing thoſe two <hi>Lovers</hi> that they were, as the happieſt, ſo the handſomeſt <hi>Couple</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>

                  <hi>Mieſlas</hi> was the firſt couzened; Inſomuch that hee cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd, hee did not think hee had been <hi>Father</hi> of ſo beautifull a <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What think you, Madam,</hi> ſaid the <hi>King</hi> turning to the <hi>Queen, were it not an impiety for a</hi> Father <hi>to diſown ſo admirable a</hi> Daughter? <hi>Shee ſeem's to mee an</hi> Angell <hi>rather</hi> (anſwered the Queen) <hi>and that ſhee hath more reaſon to acknowledge the</hi> Heaven <hi>for her</hi> Father <hi>than</hi> Mieſlas. <hi>Indeed,</hi> ſaid Florimunda, <hi>it were great Pitty that ſuch a Jewell ſhould be hidden; hence-forwards this</hi> Lady <hi>will be one of the richeſt Ornaments of the</hi> Court. <hi>That's evident</hi> (replied the King) <hi>and</hi> Liante <hi>ſhall do well to be carefull of her, for if ſo many</hi> Ladies <hi>were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of her</hi> Brother, <hi>her penetrating glances will ingender no leſs flames in diverſe</hi> Courtier's <hi>Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Royall Chamber</hi> ſeemed at that time like a Serene <hi>Heaven,</hi> wherein their <hi>Majeſties</hi> were the greater <hi>Lights;</hi> the others the

               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Oloria</hi> ſaw that glorious <hi>Star,</hi> ſhee would have hidden her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from her own <hi>Eyes.</hi> The changing of her <hi>Colour</hi> ſhewed ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the diſtemper of her <hi>thoughts,</hi> but all the Aſſembly was ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive in contemplating the incomparable IPHIGENIA, that no body took notice of her alterations.

               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> having for ſome time held her Eyes attentively fixed on IPHIGENIA'S Face, turned to <hi>Florimunda,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Siſter, by the Life of the</hi> King, <hi>my Lord, I do not think it is poſſible to finde through the whole World two Faces more like than thoſe of the</hi> Brother <hi>and the</hi> Siſter; <hi>There is but one Letter's difference in their</hi> Names, <hi>but in their</hi> Faces <hi>I finde not the leaſt tittle of exception; and if</hi> Iphigenes <hi>were in</hi> Women's <hi>cloaths, I believe we ſhould hardly be able to diſtinguiſh them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenes</hi> hearing this Diſcourſe, notwithſtanding the gravity and modeſt baſhfulneſs, wherewith hee had ſtudiouſly compoſed his Conntenance, could not refrain ſmiling, but with ſo pleaſing a <hi>grace,</hi> as obliged the <hi>Infanta</hi> to reply; <hi>Madam, There is no difference but in their action; For</hi> Iphigenes <hi>hath I know not what of</hi> Martiall <hi>in his</hi> Face, <hi>but this</hi> Lady <hi>hath a certain ſofclier look ſo full of attraction, that her ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs charm's me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> ſeverity would not have changed countenance at theſe Speeches?

               </p>
               <p>Thus he buried himſelf in the Tomb of <hi>Honour,</hi> which he had alwayes ſo much deſired, like <hi>Sampſon</hi> who died in the midſt of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> or him that was ſqueezed to <hi>Death</hi> under the <hi>Elephant</hi> which he had killed.
